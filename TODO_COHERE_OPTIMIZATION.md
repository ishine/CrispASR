# Cohere Transcribe Optimization Plan

This document tracks the progress of porting `cohere-whisper.cpp` to a full `ggml` compute graph (Priority 2B).

## Progress Tracker

- [x] **Phase 0: Infrastructure Refactoring**
    - [x] Update `cohere_model` to manage `ggml_backend_buffer` and `ggml_context` for weights properly.
    - [x] Update `cohere_context` to include `ggml_backend`, `ggml_backend_sched`, and memory allocators.
    - [x] Implement robust GGUF tensor loading into the backend buffers.
- [x] **Phase 1: Decoder Graph Port**
    - [x] Implement `cohere_build_graph_decoder`.
    - [x] Support KV caching within the graph.
    - [x] Resolve `GGML_ASSERT(ggml_can_repeat(b, a))` broadcasting issues.
    - [x] Fix `ggml_mul_mat` dimension mismatches and transpose assertions.
    - [x] Verify numerical consistency and successful iterative decoding.
- [x] **Phase 2: Encoder Graph Port**
    - [x] Implement `cohere_build_graph_encoder` (48 Conformer layers).
    - [x] Port Conv2D subsampling to `ggml_conv_2d`.
    - [x] Implement Conformer relative-position attention (relative shift) in `ggml`.
    - [x] Implement Conformer convolution module.
- [x] **Phase 3: Integration & Cleanup**
    - [x] Remove `cblas_sgemm` and `ct_linear` dependencies (Ported to graph).
    - [x] Remove manual F32 weight caching.
    - [x] Clean up redundant feature extraction and conversion logic.
- [x] **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
    - [x] Quantization tool (Q8_0, Q4_K, etc.).
    - [ ] GPU Backend support (CUDA/Metal).
    - [ ] Flash Attention for decoder.

## Current Status
- Decoder: **Graph implementation functional and verified**.
- Encoder: **Graph implementation functional and verified**. 
- Full Pipeline: **Verified correct output on sample audio.**

## Phase 5: Technical Learnings & Pitfalls (CRITICAL)

### 1. GGML Tensor Layouts & Operations
- **Conv1D Depthwise:** `ggml_conv_1d_dw` expects input layout `[T, C]` (ne0=T, ne1=C). If your hidden state is `[C, T]`, you **must** `ggml_transpose` before and `ggml_permute(1, 2, 0, 3)` after to restore layout.
- **Broadcast Bias:** To add a bias `[C]` to a tensor `[C, T]`, use `ggml_add` with a reshaped bias `[C, 1, 1, 1]`.
- **Softmax Scaling:** Conformer self-attention **requires** scaling by `1/sqrt(head_dim)` BEFORE softmax. Skipping this leads to saturated attention and broken output.

### 2. Audio Preprocessing Consistency
- **Mel Layout:** The subsampling Conv2D layers expect mel features in **time-major** layout `[T, n_mels]` (stored as `[1, n_mels, T]` for 2D conv). Storing them in mel-major layout `[n_mels, T]` will result in garbage encoder output.
- **Normalization:** Ensure per-feature normalization matches the reference (PyTorch/ONNX) exactly, including the biased/unbiased variance calculation.

### 3. GGML Infrastructure
- **GGUF Memory Bug:** `gguf_init_from_file` with `no_alloc=true` has a known edge case where it might not calculate enough overhead for the `ggml_context` if many tensors are present. Adding a safety margin (`+10` descriptors) to the allocation in `gguf.cpp` fixes this.
- **KV Cache Reset:** Use `ggml_backend_buffer_clear` instead of `memset` when the buffer is allocated on a non-CPU backend.
- **Constants:** Tensors created in a `no_alloc=false` context (like persistent constants) use `ctx->data` directly; those on backends require `ggml_backend_tensor_set`. Mixed usage must be handled carefully.
