    - [x] Remove manual F32 weight caching.
    - [x] Clean up redundant feature extraction and conversion logic.
- [x] **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
    - [x] Quantization tool (Q8_0, Q4_K, etc.).
    - [ ] GPU Backend support (CUDA/Metal).
    - [x] Flash Attention for decoder (cross-attention; self-attention: CPU GEMV faster than flash for small n_kv).
- [x] **Phase 3C: Depthwise conv im2col elimination**
    - [x] Replace `ggml_conv_1d_dw` (im2col + mul_mat) with `ggml_conv_2d_dw_direct` (GGML_OP_CONV_2D_DW, no intermediate buffer). Cast F16 kernel to F32 in-graph, reshape [k,1,d]→[k,1,1,d]; use cont+transpose+reshape for WHCN input. im2col: 810ms (n=53) → 85ms (n=5, only subsampling), 9.6× faster for K=9 depthwise. RTF 1.12×→1.24× (10% enc speedup).
- [x] **Phase 3B: Post-graph micro-optimizations**
    - [x] BatchNorm folding: fold BN stats into conv_dw weights at load time (480 nodes removed, ~7% F16 enc speedup, Q4_K → RTF 1.15×).
    - [x] mmap weight loading: replace fread+vector into mmap to eliminate heap churn (done; load time = disk I/O, not software overhead).
    - [x] Per-op profiler: `COHERE_PROF=1` — eval_callback shows mul_mat=87.6%, im2col=7.0% for 44s audio.
    - [x] Metal/GPU backend: `ggml_backend_load_all()` + `ggml_backend_init_best()` + CPU fallback in sched; `COHERE_DEVICE=metal|cuda|cpu`; CMake: `GGML_METAL=ON` / `GGML_CUDA=ON`.
    - [x] Chunked encoder: process long audio in 30s windows to cap O(T²) attention cost.
    - [x] Decoder sched pre-reserve: call `ggml_backend_sched_reserve` with a max-offset step graph after the prompt pass so that gallocr's `size_max` covers all future autoregressive steps; `ggml_gallocr_needs_realloc` returns false and the re-planning cost is eliminated (dec sched alloc: 0.65 → 0.22 ms/step, 66% reduction).
    - [x] Encoder attention: remove redundant `ggml_cont` from Q_u and Q_v (second args of `mul_mat`); CPU backend's `from_float` handles non-contiguous src1 directly, eliminating the intermediate F32 copy and reducing cache pressure (−96 cont ops, enc compute ~8% faster).
    - [x] F16 cross-KV cache: convert F32 encoder output to F16 on CPU via `ggml_fp32_to_fp16_row` before uploading to `GGML_TYPE_F16` cross-KV backend tensors; decoder `ggml_mul_mat(F16_CK, F32_CQ)` handled natively. Cross-KV memory halved (8.6→4.3 MiB for JFK, ~70→~35 MiB for 89s audio). **Pitfall**: using `ggml_cast(..., GGML_TYPE_F16)` inside the encoder compute graph corrupts data (GGML_OP_CPY with `src[1]=result` self-reference confuses the gallocr) — always convert on the CPU side.

## Current Status
- Decoder: **Graph implementation functional and verified**.
- Encoder: **Graph implementation functional and verified**. 
- Full Pipeline: **Verified correct output on sample audio.**
- BatchNorm folding: **Done and verified** — 4940→4460 nodes, F16 RTF 0.96×, Q4_K RTF 1.15× (real-time).
- Chunked encoder (30s windows): **Done and verified** — 89s audio Q4_K 4-thread: RTF 1.07× vs 1.26× full-audio (16% speedup). Threads=1: 0.35×, threads=2: 0.66×, threads=4: 1.07×.
- Decoder sched pre-reserve: **Done and verified** — dec sched alloc 0.65 → 0.22 ms/step (66% reduction).
- Encoder attention cont removal: **Done and verified** — removed redundant cont on Q_u/Q_v, enc compute ~8% faster (11.3s → 10.4s for 12s audio).
- F16 cross-KV cache: **Done and verified** — cross-kv memory halved (8.6→4.3 MiB for JFK, ~35 MiB for 89s audio). CPU `ggml_fp32_to_fp16_row` conversion, not in-graph cast.
- Depthwise conv im2col elimination: **Done and verified** — `ggml_conv_2d_dw_direct` replaces `ggml_conv_1d_dw`; im2col 810→85ms (9.6× faster for K=9); enc RTF 1.12→1.24× for 11s JFK audio, 4 threads Q4_K.
- Flash attention for cross-attention: **Done and verified** — encoder now produces CV in `[hd, T, H]` layout (same as CK); decoder uses `ggml_flash_attn_ext` for cross-attention (no mask); multi-chunk V scatter simplified to contiguous block-copy (matches K scatter). Self-attention uses standard GEMV path (CPU flash_attn_ext is slower for small n_kv). **Pitfall**: storing V in `[hd, T, H]` and reverting to standard mul_mat requires an expensive in-graph transpose (18MB/step for long audio) — don't do this. Flash cross-attn is neutral on CPU and fast on GPU.

## Phase 5: Technical Learnings & Pitfalls (CRITICAL)

### 1. GGML Tensor Layouts & Operations
- **Conv1D Depthwise:** `ggml_conv_1d_dw` expects input layout `[T, C]` (ne0=T, ne1=C). If your hidden state is `[C, T]`, you **must** `ggml_transpose` before and `ggml_permute(1, 2, 0, 3)` after to restore layout.
- **Broadcast Bias:** To add a bias `[C]` to a tensor `[C, T]`, use `ggml_add` with a reshaped bias `[C, 1, 1, 1]`.
- **Softmax Scaling:** Conformer self-attention **requires** scaling by `1/sqrt(head_dim)` BEFORE softmax. Skipping this leads to saturated attention and broken output.

### 2. Audio Preprocessing Consistency
- **Mel Layout:** The subsampling Conv2D layers expect mel features in **time-major** layout `[T, n_mels]` (stored as `[1, n_mels, T]` for 2D conv). Storing them in mel-major layout `[n_mels, T]` will result in garbage encoder output.
- **Normalization:** Ensure per-feature normalization matches the reference (PyTorch/ONNX) exactly, including the biased/unbiased variance calculation.

### 4. Chunked Encoder Cross-KV Assembly
- **Per-chunk extraction, not standalone graph:** A standalone GGML cross-KV graph (taking concatenated enc_out as input) CANNOT be run through the same `ggml_backend_sched` that was used for the encoder graph. The `gallocr` buffer reset reuses the same virtual buffer; its allocated addresses overlap with input tensors, causing enc_in to be overwritten during computation.
- **Fix:** Extract ck/cv directly from each chunk's encoder graph (same proven path as single-chunk), copy to CPU vectors, then scatter-copy into the final `[head_dim, T_total, n_heads]` (K) and `[T_total, head_dim, n_heads]` (V) layouts before uploading to the backend buffer.
- **K scatter:** For head h, chunk c contributes a contiguous block at `k_full[h × T_total × hd + T_so_far × hd]`.
- **V scatter:** For head h and dim d, chunk c contributes a contiguous slice at `v_full[h × hd × T_total + d × T_total + T_so_far]`.

### 3. GGML Infrastructure
- **GGUF Memory Bug:** `gguf_init_from_file` with `no_alloc=true` has a known edge case where it might not calculate enough overhead for the `ggml_context` if many tensors are present. Adding a safety margin (`+10` descriptors) to the allocation in `gguf.cpp` fixes this.
- **KV Cache Reset:** Use `ggml_backend_buffer_clear` instead of `memset` when the buffer is allocated on a non-CPU backend.
- **Constants:** Tensors created in a `no_alloc=false` context (like persistent constants) use `ctx->data` directly; those on backends require `ggml_backend_tensor_set`. Mixed usage must be handled carefully.
