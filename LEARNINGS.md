# CrispASR — Technical learnings

Distilled from months of porting eight ASR architectures into one ggml
codebase. Nothing here is breaking news; everything here is something
we'd have saved days if we'd known up front.

If a lesson is still "live" (affects current work), it's linked from
`TODO.md`. If it's historical (a bug we already fixed), it's linked from
`HISTORY.md`.

## ggml / inference engine

### RoPE mode mapping: ALWAYS `NEOX` for modern models

The single most expensive bug in this project was shipping Granite with
`GGML_ROPE_TYPE_NORMAL` (mode=0) when HF models use `rotate_half`-style
RoPE. The two modes pair different dimension indices:

- `GGML_ROPE_TYPE_NEOX` (mode=2) pairs `(i, i+d/2)` — matches HF
  `rotate_half`. **This is what Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Granite, Gemma,
  GPT-NeoX, and basically every modern LLM uses.**
- `GGML_ROPE_TYPE_NORMAL` (mode=0) pairs adjacent dims `(0,1), (2,3)…`
  Very few models use this. If you can't find a citation for it in the
  model's reference code, you probably don't want it.

Signature of the bug: the model loads, runs, and generates fluent-looking
text — but it's garbage. Byte-level detail preservation at the layer
boundaries hides it for the first few layers; by layer 40 the hidden
state is in the wrong basis and the LM head picks nonsense tokens. The
giveaway is that the Python reference transcript is perfect and the
ggml transcript is fluent but wrong. Always diff against the reference
at each layer boundary.

### Flash attention tensor layout

`ggml_flash_attn_ext(Q, K, V, mask, scale, max_bias, logit_softcap)`
expects Q, K, V in `[head_dim, T, n_heads]` layout with their final
dimension stride 1. If you've computed Q/K/V as `[d_model, T]` from a
`ggml_mul_mat`, you need three steps to get there:

1. `ggml_reshape_3d(_, hd, n_heads, T)` — expose the head dim
2. `ggml_permute(_, 0, 2, 1, 3)` — swap `n_heads` and `T`
3. `ggml_cont(_, …)` — flash-attn requires contiguous memory

Skipping the `ggml_cont` causes a silent shape error downstream. The
output comes back as `[head_dim, n_heads, T, 1]` and you need a
`ggml_reshape_2d(_, hd * n_heads, T)` to collapse it back into `[d, T]`
for the output projection.

### GQA native support vs explicit expansion

`ggml_flash_attn_ext` natively handles GQA when `n_kv_heads < n_heads`
and the K/V tensors have the right shape — it broadcasts each KV head
across `n_heads / n_kv_heads` query heads internally. BUT the K/V
tensors must be laid out as `[head_dim, T, n_kv_heads]`, not
`[head_dim, T, n_heads]`.

If you manually expand KV via `ggml_repeat_4d` before calling flash-attn,
you get a more memory-hungry but more forgiving path that works with
either layout. All three of voxtral, voxtral4b, qwen3, and granite LLM
blocks do the explicit expand for simplicity.

### `ggml_backend_sched` lifetime

Two common patterns, with very different performance:

- **Create once, reset between calls.** Create the scheduler at model
  init with the worst-case graph size (whichever of your stages is
  largest — usually the LLM prefill), and call `ggml_backend_sched_reset`
  between compute calls. Near-zero per-call overhead.
- **Recreate every call.** This is what qwen3/voxtral currently do
  because their graph sizes differ between stages (conv, encoder, LLM
  prefill, LLM decode step). Cheap in absolute terms but adds ~5-15 ms
  per call, which matters for the single-token decode loop.

Fix: compute the max graph node count once at init by building the
largest graph variant and measuring its node count, then create a
single scheduler with that budget and `reset` between stages. See
`TODO.md` under "Per-model follow-ups → qwen3 / voxtral".

### Flash attention on prefill AND decode

The LLM-based backends all use `ggml_flash_attn_ext` for prefill. Using
it for the single-token decode step too (not just prefill) halves the
decode-time graph size and runs ~2× faster on CPU. Qwen3 and voxtral
already do this. Check any new backend's per-token wall time to
confirm it's taking this path.

### In-place recursive FFTs are const-unsafe

voxtral / voxtral4b / qwen3 ship a recursive radix-2 Cooley-Tukey FFT
that treats its input buffer as 4× scratch space during recursion.
These can't be called through a `const float *` function pointer —
they modify memory past their nominal input length. When integrating
with `core_mel::FftR2C` (which has a const-input contract), wrap the
FFT with a thread-local scratch copy:

```cpp
static void model_fft_wrapper(const float * in, int N, float * out) {
    static thread_local std::vector<float> scratch_in;
    static thread_local std::vector<float> scratch_out;
    if ((int)scratch_in.size()  < 4 * N) scratch_in.assign((size_t)4 * N, 0);
    if ((int)scratch_out.size() < 8 * N) scratch_out.assign((size_t)8 * N, 0);
    std::memcpy(scratch_in.data(), in, (size_t)N * sizeof(float));
    model_fft(scratch_in.data(), N, scratch_out.data());
    std::memcpy(out, scratch_out.data(), (size_t)(2 * N) * sizeof(float));
}
```

One allocation per thread, zero per-call heap churn.

## Mel spectrograms

### Two algorithm clusters, not one

Nine model files in `src/` had nine different mel implementations.
They fall into exactly two clusters, distinguished by log base and
normalisation scheme. Knowing this upfront would have collapsed the
refactor into one parameterised function.

| Cluster | Log | Normalisation | Output layout | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NeMo** | `ln` | per-mel z-score | `(T, n_mels)` | parakeet, canary, canary_ctc, cohere |
| **HF / Whisper** | `log10` | global clip `(max(x, max(x)-8) + 4) / 4` | `(n_mels, T)` | whisper, qwen3, voxtral, voxtral4b, granite |

Sub-variants you'll hit once per cluster:
- `log_guard_mode`: NeMo uses `log(x + eps)`, HF uses `log(max(x, eps))`.
  Numerically close but not identical.
- `matmul_precision`: NeMo uses `float` accumulator, HF uses `double`.
  This matters for bit-exact regression against PyTorch reference.
- `fb_layout`: NeMo stores the filterbank as `[n_mels, n_freqs]`, HF
  stores it as `[n_freqs, n_mels]`. Transposed.
- `drop_last_frame`: HF drops the last STFT frame; NeMo keeps it.
- `drop_first_frame_if_odd`: voxtral4b needs even T for a stride-2 conv.
- `pad_to_T`: voxtral 3B pads to 3000 frames (= 30s) AFTER log, BEFORE
  normalisation, using `log(eps)` as the pad value so padded frames
  don't skew the global-clip max.
- `stacked_frames`: granite's output is `(160, T/2)` = two 80-mel
  frames zipped along channels. (Still inline — see TODO.md.)

See `src/core/mel.h` for the parameterised version.

### Cohere's cohere_fft_r2c + pre-emphasis

Cohere is the one NeMo-cluster model that doesn't fit the others
cleanly: it applies a `samples[i] = samples[i] - 0.97 * samples[i-1]`
pre-emphasis filter before the STFT. Easy to handle — do the pre-
emphasis in the model wrapper, then call `core_mel::compute` on the
pre-emphasised signal.

Cohere also uses `cblas_sgemm` for the power→mel matmul. When we
migrated to the manual accumulator in `core_mel`, the summation order
changes slightly and one SRT timestamp shifted by 80 ms (one encoder
frame). The transcript text is bit-identical. If bit-exact BLAS
output becomes a hard requirement, a BLAS-backed matmul path can be
added to `core_mel` behind a feature flag.

---

## Quantisation and memory

### Q4_K is the production default

Across every model we've benchmarked, Q4_K has been the sweet spot:

- **parakeet**: F16 9.3s → Q4_K 5.3s (1.75× faster, 0.97× realtime CPU, quality identical)
- **canary**: F16 13.0s → Q4_K 6.5s (2.0× faster, 1.19× realtime CPU)
- **cohere**: F16 27.6s → Q4_K 14.8s (1.87× faster, 2.72× slower than realtime)
- **qwen3-asr**: Q4_K 6.5s on jfk.wav (1.7× realtime)
- **voxtral 3B**: 70s total, 242 ms/token (3B is heavy on CPU)
- **voxtral 4B Realtime**: F16 133s → Q4_K 49s (2.7× faster, 0.22× realtime CPU)
- **granite 1B**: Q4_K 22.5s on jfk.wav (0.49× realtime)

Q5_0, Q6_K, Q8_0 are marginal improvements on smaller models but don't
close the gap to Q4_K in wall-clock tests. F16 is 2-3× slower than
Q4_K on CPU with no measurable quality improvement for ASR.

### Baked mel filterbank, baked Hann window

Every model's GGUF stores the mel filterbank and Hann window as regular
F32 tensors, not as arrays of numbers in the GGUF metadata. The
`core_mel::compute` function reads them via `ggml_backend_tensor_get`
at inference time. Pros: same precision as the Python reference, no
numerical drift from Slaney reconstruction in C++; cons: a couple hundred
KB of extra weight bytes. Worth it.

### F16 KV cache is non-negotiable for LLM backends

Qwen3/voxtral/voxtral4b/granite LLM KV caches are all F16. Cohere's
self-attention KV is still F32 (historical, see TODO.md for the planned
upgrade). Halves GPU memory and bandwidth with no observable quality
loss in ASR workloads.

---

## CPU vs ONNX vs PyTorch baselines

### Where the time goes (Cohere, 11s clip, 8-thread CPU)

Representative profile from the Q4_K path:

| Op | % of time |
|---|---:|
| `mul_mat` | 87.6% |
| `im2col` (conv subsampling) | 7.0% |
| Everything else | 5.4% |

`mul_mat` at 87.6% is near hardware peak for F16 GEMM. Any optimisation
that doesn't move the `mul_mat` number is noise.

### Where ONNX beats ggml on x86 (and doesn't on Metal)

Measured on a 44s clip, x86 4-thread CPU, quantised:

| Implementation | Encoder | Decoder | Total | RTFx | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ONNX INT8 (CPU) | 19.5s | 11.7s | 31.2s | 1.44× | DNNL AVX-512 INT8 GEMM |
| ONNX INT4 (CPU) | 22.5s | 12.7s | 35.2s | 1.28× | INT4 weight-only |
| **ggml Q4_K (CPU)** | 42.1s | **3.1s** | 45.4s | 0.99× | ggml AVX2 |
| ggml F16 (CPU) | 49.1s | 4.1s | 53.5s | 0.84× | ggml AVX-512 F16 |
| PyTorch F16 (A100 GPU) | — | — | ~1-2s | ~25× | baseline |

Two observations:

1. **ONNX is ~2× faster in the encoder** on x86 CPUs with AVX-VNNI, because
   DNNL uses `vpdpbusd` for INT8 GEMM and ggml's `vec_dot_q8_0_q8_0`
   still uses `pmaddubsw`/`pmaddwd`. There is no CPU path to close this
   gap without implementing AVX-512 INT8 GEMM in ggml's `quants.c`.
   Tracked in `UPSTREAM.md`.

2. **ggml is 3-4× faster in the decoder.** ONNX passes the full KV cache
   (~268 MB) across the Python→ONNX→Python boundary on every decode
   step. For 167 tokens that's ~45 GB of unnecessary data movement.
   Our ggml in-place KV cache with tensor views moves zero bytes. This
   advantage grows with output length.

On Metal or CUDA, the encoder gap closes entirely: our ggml graphs
already use ops that have GPU kernels (`ggml_mul_mat`,
`ggml_conv_2d_dw_direct`, `ggml_flash_attn_ext`). An M1 Metal run of
the same Cohere clip hits ~11.9× realtime compared to 1.24× Q4_K CPU.

### Python and Rust libtorch are both ~25-30× realtime

Both `transformers` and `cohere_transcribe_rs` (tch crate) go through
libtorch CPU F32 and land at ~160s for a 5.4s clip. There is no easy
win on the Rust side without switching backends.

---

## Audio format lessons

### miniaudio + stb_vorbis handle the common cases

Out of the box, every ASR runtime in this repo accepts WAV / FLAC / MP3
/ OGG Vorbis at any bit depth, any sample rate (auto-resampled to
16 kHz), mono or stereo (auto-mixed to mono). No external dependencies.
The two embedded single-header decoders (`miniaudio`, `stb_vorbis`) are
enough for 95% of real-world ASR pipelines.

### `WHISPER_FFMPEG=ON` only helps bare Opus

Upstream whisper.cpp's `examples/ffmpeg-transcode.cpp` has known bugs
on mp4-family containers: `.m4a` crashes with `munmap_chunk(): invalid
pointer` on the first audio chunk read, and `.webm` (Opus-in-WebM)
hangs indefinitely after the libavformat headers are parsed. Both use
the same `av_read_frame` + `avcodec_send_packet` loop.

Bare-codec `.opus` files work cleanly in the FFmpeg build. So the
practical advice is: enable `WHISPER_FFMPEG=ON` only if you need
in-process `.opus` decoding. For everything else, pre-convert:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le -y /tmp/audio.wav
```

This is the universally safe path and identical to what the in-process
path would produce if it worked. Documented in `UPSTREAM.md` with a
minimal reproducer.

---

## Language handling

### Auto-detect can silently code-switch

Parakeet's auto-language-ID works well for clean speech but drifts into
English on German clips with technical vocabulary or proper nouns. A
90-second German clip about "Industrial Forschung" and "Technische
Universität" came back with "Industrial Forschung" and "Tech Technische
University" in the transcript. **This is not a chunking issue — VAD-based
segmentation gives the same code-switching.** The encoder classifies the
clip correctly but the decoder drops into English mid-stream on lexical
hints.

Lessons:
1. For production use on a known language, always prefer a model with
   an explicit language flag. Canary's `-sl de -tl de` is the fix — the
   decoder is forced into German by the task-token prefix and cannot
   code-switch.
2. Auto-detect models are better for mixed-language pipelines where the
   language isn't known.
3. Test with vocabulary-heavy, non-English clips before shipping. Clean
   short phrases pass every test you give them.

### Canary's prompt prefix is the mechanism, not magic

Canary's "explicit language" feature is implemented as a task-token
prefix in the decoder prompt, before the audio encoder output. Specifically:

```
<|startofcontext|>[source_lang][target_lang]<|transcribe|>[punctuation]
```

When `source_lang != target_lang`, the task token is `<|translate|>`
instead of `<|transcribe|>`. This is how canary does speech translation
(DE→EN, EN→FR, etc.) in the same model.

## Model architecture comparisons

### Voxtral: CrispASR standalone vs llama.cpp mtmd vs max-lt wrapper

Three independent C++ implementations of Voxtral-Mini-3B exist. We
compared them head-to-head and the conclusion was important enough to
preserve.

| | **CrispASR** | max-lt/voxtral-cpp | llama.cpp mtmd |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model files | 1 GGUF | 2 (model + mmproj) | 2 (model + mmproj) |
| Tokenizer | Embedded Tekken blob | llama.cpp native | llama.cpp native |
| LLM forward | Hand-written ggml | llama.cpp core | llama.cpp core |
| [BEGIN_AUDIO] bug | ✔ not affected | needs patch | needs manual fix |
| 30s truncation | ✔ not affected | affected | affected |
| Diff-tested vs PyTorch | ✔ every stage | ✗ | ✗ |
| Lines of model code | ~1300 | ~100 wrapper | 0 (all in llama.cpp) |
| GPU support | ✗ (CPU-only now) | ✔ via llama.cpp | ✔ via llama.cpp |

The llama.cpp `mtmd` multimodal subsystem has two known bugs affecting
Voxtral specifically ([#17868](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/17868),
[#18419](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/18419)) that
were ignored by maintainers, and a community member reports worse
accuracy in llama.cpp than in transformers/vLLM at the same precision.
Ollama dropped llama.cpp specifically for multimodal due to
instability.

**Recommendation:** keep CrispASR as its own standalone ggml runtime
for ASR. It is diff-tested against PyTorch at every architectural
boundary (LLM cosine sim 0.999973, top-5 5/5 match on identical inputs),
which is the confidence our users need. Do NOT rewrite it on top of
mtmd. When we want GPU, use ggml's Metal/CUDA backends directly on our
existing graph builders — `ggml_flash_attn_ext` already has GPU kernels.
The main work is wiring up `ggml_backend_metal_init()` /
`ggml_backend_cuda_init()` as alternatives to the CPU backend (~50 LOC).

---

## Regression testing discipline

Every migration commit in `src/core/` includes a `md5sum`-level
regression test against `samples/jfk.wav`. The discipline:

1. Run the current binary, capture output + auxiliary outputs (SRT/VTT/JSON)
2. Make the change
3. Rebuild
4. Re-run, compare with `md5sum` and `diff`
5. If bit-identical, commit. If not, investigate.

Two cases where bit-identity is not achievable:

1. **Cohere mel migration.** CBLAS sgemm → manual accumulator changes
   the float summation order, shifting one SRT boundary by 80 ms (one
   encoder frame). Transcript text is byte-identical. Accepted.
2. **Whisper code path.** Untouched by `src/core/` refactors; bit-
   identical against upstream `whisper-cli` is the gate.

The few FFNs / attention blocks where ggml graph op ordering matters
have all come back bit-identical so far. Flash attention results
depend on the order Q/K/V were committed to the graph, but as long as
the helper emits them in the same order the inline code did, you get
bit-identical output.

---

## Specific bugs that cost us a day each

These are each preserved in `HISTORY.md` with full context. Summary form:

1. **Granite RoPE mode (NEOX vs NORMAL).** Model loaded, ran, produced
   fluent nonsense. Fix: one enum value.
2. **Voxtral 4B realtime audio padding.** `32*1280 + 17*1280 + 1280*(right_align)`
   left and right pads are non-negotiable. Skipping the right pad
   silently breaks the encoder graph reshape.
3. **Voxtral 4B Realtime audio_length_per_tok=8.** 3B uses 4 (one audio
   frame per 4 Whisper frames); 4B uses 8. Wrong value → audio-to-token
   alignment off by 2× and transcript drifts.
4. **Cohere F32 self-attention KV.** Still not fixed; costs 2× GPU
   memory. Tracked in TODO.
5. **Qwen3 windowed attention.** Chunked self-attention via `cu_seqlens`
   with window size ~104 positions. Standard full self-attention
   produces wrong output. This is the trickiest part of the qwen3 port.
6. **Hann window centering in Granite mel.** The window must be
   symmetrically zero-padded to n_fft; off-by-one on the centering shifts
   the power spectrum peak and breaks downstream everything.
7. **Q-Former layer norm target.** BLIP-2 projector LN applies to the
   query tokens, not the encoder output. Wrong tensor → garbage projector
   output → garbage LLM input → garbage transcript.
8. **Silero LID: five compounding bugs.** The native port of Silero's
   95-language classifier went through Swedish → Mongolian → Bashkir →
   Khmer → Chinese → Punjabi → English on jfk.wav, each fix changing
   the top prediction. Root causes, in order of severity:
   (a) **Front-end padding.** ONNX uses constant zero-pad 160/side on
       audio; we used reflection-pad 320 on the left. The padding type
       and amount are buried in a Pad node with a dynamically-computed
       pad vector from a chain of 15 ONNX ops.
   (b) **Stride-2 output size.** Conv1d(T, k=1, s=2) output is
       `(T-1)/2+1`, not `T/2`. Off-by-one cascades through 4 stride-2
       stages (1101→551→276→138→69) — wrong value drops 1 frame per
       stage, silently shifting the feature alignment.
   (c) **QKV split order.** ONNX slices QKV as K[0:D], Q[D:2D],
       V[2D:3D]. We assumed Q,K,V order. The only way to discover this
       is to dump the Slice node inputs and compare the split boundaries.
   (d) **Missing ReLU after stride-1 projections.** Stages 4-7 use
       stride-1 Conv1x1→ReLU for dim change (128→192). The ReLU is
       easy to miss since the stride-2 stages already had it.
   (e) **Missing tanh in attention pooling.** ONNX does dot→Tanh→
       Softmax; we did dot→Softmax. The Tanh compresses the score
       range, which completely changes the attention distribution.
   **Lesson:** When porting an unfamiliar ONNX model, dump intermediates
   at every graph boundary and diff against the native code BEFORE
   debugging individual ops. The bug is almost never where you expect.

---

## Quantization

### Small models with conv-heavy architectures resist quantization

The Silero LID model (16 MB F32, 507 tensors) was tested with Q8_0 and
Q5_0 quantization. Both broke accuracy completely (French/Shona instead
of English). The model's parameters are mostly small Conv1d kernels
(dw_conv [5,1,C], pw_conv [1,C,C]) where C ∈ {128, 161, 192}. These
tensors have very few elements per row (1-5), making block quantization
destructive. Only the transformer QKV/out/FFN projections and classifiers
(34 of 507 tensors) have enough elements per row to quantize safely, but
that saves only 3-5 MB — not worth the accuracy loss.

**Rule of thumb:** If a model's parameter count is dominated by Conv1d
kernels with small spatial dimensions (k ≤ 5) and few channels (C < 256),
ship it F32. The 16 MB F32 Silero LID model is smaller than a single
layer of most ASR encoders — quantization is pointless.

---

## Methodical debugging of ported models against ground truth

This is the single most important workflow in the project. Every model
port that "almost works" but produces wrong output will eat days unless
you follow this process systematically.

### The protocol

1. **Get a reference implementation that provably works.** Either the
   original Python/ONNX model (preferred — run via onnxruntime), or a
   known-good C++ implementation. If ONNX: add all internal nodes as
   graph outputs and run with intermediate capture.

2. **Dump intermediates at every graph boundary.** Not just input/output
   — dump after EVERY stage: normalization, projection, attention,
   FFN, residual add. Save as `.npy` files with clear names.

3. **Compare C++ vs reference at each stage, starting from the INPUT.**
   Don't start debugging the attention if the input is already wrong.
   Print first 8-16 values of each tensor at frame t=0. The divergence
   point tells you exactly which operation is broken.

4. **When you find the divergence point, check these in order:**
   - **Tensor layout/transpose** — ggml uses ne[0]-fastest (column-major).
     A `[T, H]` row-major C array becomes `[H, T]` in ggml (ne[0]=H).
   - **Weight shapes** — GGUF stores shapes in ggml ne-order. A numpy
     `(1024, 4096)` weight becomes ggml ne `[1024, 4096]`. For
     `ggml_mul_mat(W, x)` = W^T @ x, we need `W.ne[0] == x.ne[0]`.
   - **Padding type and amount** — zero vs reflect vs replicate. ONNX
     Pad nodes encode padding as a dynamically-computed vector from
     chains of 10+ ops. Always dump the actual padded tensor.
   - **Activation functions** — missing ReLU, tanh, GELU. These are
     easy to miss when tracing the ONNX graph manually.
   - **Operation order** — pre-norm vs post-norm, attention before or
     after stride-2, QKV split order.
   - **Formula details** — stride-2 output is `(T-1)/2+1` not `T/2`.
     Reflection padding `pad[i] = data[pad_size - i]` not `data[i]`.
     Scale factor in attention: 1/sqrt(head_dim) not 1/sqrt(d_model).

5. **For ggml graph debugging specifically:**
   - The `ggml_backend_sched` may not correctly associate model weight
     tensors with their backend buffer. Test with `ggml_backend_alloc`
     instead of the scheduler for isolation.
   - Mark tensors with `ggml_set_name()` and read them with
     `ggml_backend_tensor_get()` BEFORE calling `ggml_backend_sched_free()`.
   - F16 weight tensors in ggml_mul_mat work correctly in single mini-
     graphs (as in `ggml_linear_f32()`) but may misbehave in large
     graphs where the scheduler manages buffer allocation.
   - When in doubt, build a 1-layer graph first and verify it matches
     the manual path before scaling to all layers.

6. **Never trust "close enough".** If the first frame's values differ
   by more than 1e-4 from the reference, there's a bug. Float32
   accumulation order can cause ~1e-5 drift per operation, so after
   24 transformer layers you might see ~1e-3 drift — but a 0.1
   difference at layer 0 means a structural bug.

### Common traps

- **ONNX QKV split order is not always Q,K,V.** Silero LID uses K,Q,V.
  The only way to know is to dump the Slice node boundaries.
- **ONNX padding is computed dynamically.** Don't assume reflect/zero
  from the model architecture — dump the Pad node's padding vector.
- **ONNX Reshape+Transpose chains for multi-head attention** can
  interleave heads differently than simple offset slicing. Always
  dump the post-reshape tensors to verify head layout.
- **ggml_norm normalizes over ne[0].** Make sure ne[0] is the feature
  dimension, not the time dimension.

## ggml graph allocation: gallocr vs compute_with_ctx

### gallocr/sched corrupt external weight tensors

When a ggml graph references tensors from an external context (e.g. model
weights loaded via `core_gguf::load_weights`), `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph`
and `ggml_backend_sched` reallocate buffers for these tensors, overwriting
their data with uninitialized memory. This was confirmed by a minimal
single-op test:

- `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` (no allocator): **correct** — directly
  accesses `tensor->data` pointers, which point to the loaded GGUF data.
- `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph` + `ggml_backend_graph_compute`: **wrong** —
  the allocator sees the external tensors as "unallocated" despite having
  valid `->data` and `->buffer` pointers, and allocates new buffers over
  them.

The `ggml_gallocr_is_allocated()` function at ggml-alloc.c:591 checks
`t->data != NULL || t->buffer != NULL`, which should catch external
tensors. But the two-phase reserve+alloc flow apparently doesn't preserve
this across the reserve step.

**Workaround:** Use `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` with `no_alloc=false`
for the graph context. All intermediate tensors get memory from the
context pool, and external weight tensors are referenced via their
existing `->data` pointers. Downside: no memory reuse between layers —
each intermediate stays alive for the entire graph (~80 MB/layer for
wav2vec2-large with 549 frames).

### ggml 2D tensor layout and transpose

ggml stores 2D tensor `[ne[0], ne[1]]` as `data[i0 + i1 * ne[0]]`.
A tensor with `ne[0]=V, ne[1]=T` has element `(v, t)` at `data[v + t*V]`.
This is the SAME memory layout as a C row-major array `float arr[T][V]`
where `arr[t][v] = data[t*V + v]`. So **no transpose needed** when
converting between ggml `[V, T]` and C `[T, V]` row-major — they're
the same bytes. The earlier wav2vec2 code had wrong transposes at THREE
places (input, layer readback, LM head input) that shuffled data into
garbage. The fix was to remove ALL transposes and use `memcpy` /
`std::copy` directly. **When in doubt, don't transpose.**

### Layer-by-layer graph execution as a gallocr workaround

When `ggml_gallocr` corrupts external weight tensors, building one
graph per transformer layer with `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` and
`no_alloc=false` is a viable workaround. Each layer graph uses ~80 MB
(for wav2vec2-large with T=549, H=1024, 16 heads) and is freed after
use, so total RSS stays at ~800 MB instead of 3+ GB. The hidden state
is copied in/out of each layer graph via `memcpy`. Per-layer max_diff
vs the manual reference path is < 0.005 (float32 accumulation noise).

This is slower than a single-graph approach (24 context alloc/free
cycles + 24 graph plans) but produces correct results and uses much
less memory. Good enough for CPU; for GPU acceleration, fixing gallocr
to skip pre-allocated tensors is the proper solution.

## Performance: what faster-whisper / insanely-fast-whisper do

Analysed SYSTRAN/faster-whisper and Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper
(April 2026). Key techniques and applicability to ggml:

**Already have in CrispASR:**
- Quantization (Q4_K/Q5_0/Q8_0) — fundamental to ggml
- Flash attention (ggml_flash_attn_ext) — used by whisper backend
- VAD pre-filtering (Silero) — skips silence before transcription
- Multi-file parallelism (n_processors)

**Could add (GPU-dependent, large impact):**
- **Batched encoder** — process N audio chunks simultaneously on GPU.
  Faster-whisper's `BatchedInferencePipeline` with batch_size=8 gives
  3-5x speedup. Requires GPU (batch doesn't help much on CPU since
  we already use all cores per chunk).
- **Speculative decoding** — use a small "draft" model to predict
  tokens, verify with the large model. 2-4x speedup for autoregressive
  LLM backends (granite, voxtral, qwen3). Needs two models loaded.

**Could add (CPU-friendly, moderate impact):**
- **Pipelined mel+encode** — while LLM decodes chunk N, compute mel
  for chunk N+1 in a background thread. ~15-20% speedup for LLM
  backends on multi-core CPUs.
- **Encoder output caching** — for repeated queries on the same audio
  (e.g. trying different languages), cache the encoder output and only
  re-run the decoder. Already implicit in whisper's architecture.

**Not applicable:**
- CTranslate2's CUDA kernels — ggml has its own CUDA backend
- BetterTransformer API — PyTorch-specific
- fp16 compute — ggml already does F16 matmul natively

**Bottom line:** On CPU, we're already within 2x of the theoretical
limit (2.2x realtime for parakeet on jfk.wav). The big wins are
GPU-specific: batched encoder (5x) and speculative decoding (2-4x).

**Implemented optimizations (April 2026):**
- Parallel VAD slice transcription (thread pool with separate backend
  instances — helps on GPU where each instance uses a separate stream)
- Full-graph ggml_backend_sched path for wav2vec2 with explicit weight
  tensor assignment via `ggml_backend_sched_set_tensor_backend` — GPU-
  ready single-graph dispatch for all 24 transformer layers
- Buffer reuse across layers (saves 24×80MB alloc/free cycles)
- Server-mode audio cache (instant response on repeated queries)
- Realtime speed reporting per file
- All model weights loaded to GPU when ggml_backend_init_best() picks
  a GPU backend (already built into core_gguf::load_weights)

**Key discovery:** `ggml_backend_sched_set_tensor_backend()` prevents
the scheduler from reallocating external weight tensors. This was the
missing piece for making the full-graph path work with model weights
on a separate buffer. Without it, gallocr corrupts external tensors.

### Windows fseek overflow: the silent >2 GB file killer

On Windows (MSVC), `long` is 32-bit even on x86_64. `fseek(fp, (long)offset, SEEK_SET)`
silently wraps around at 2^31 = 2.1 GB. For GGUF files larger than
this (voxtral4b Q4_K = 2.35 GB, Q8_0 = 4.4 GB), tensors stored past
the 2 GB boundary get read from the wrong file offset, resulting in
"missing tensor" errors or corrupt data.

The fix: `_fseeki64()` on Windows, `fseeko()` on POSIX. Also add
native Windows mmap (`CreateFileMapping` + `MapViewOfFile`) to bypass
the fseek path entirely.

**Lesson:** `fseek(fp, (long)x, ...)` is a bug on Windows for any file
that might exceed 2 GB. Always use platform-specific 64-bit seek. This
is a classic portability trap that doesn't manifest on Linux/macOS
(where `long` is 64-bit on LP64).

## VAD integration and long audio (April 2026)

### whisper VAD returns centiseconds, not seconds

The `whisper_vad_segments_get_segment_t0/t1()` functions return
timestamps in **centiseconds** (e.g. 29.0 = 0.29 seconds), not
seconds. Our initial integration multiplied by `sample_rate` directly,
producing sample indices 100× too large. Every segment fell past the
end of the audio, causing "no speech detected" for every file.

**Lesson:** Always check the units of external API return values. The
whisper.cpp VAD API stores `start`/`end` via `samples_to_cs()` (line
5676) and the internal code divides by 100.0 for display (line 6914).
The getter functions return the raw centisecond values.

### Short VAD segments break ASR quality

Silero VAD can produce very short segments (0.35s) for speech with
brief pauses. These are too short for most ASR encoders to produce
reliable output. On jfk.wav (11s), the VAD split into 5 segments of
0.35-2.4s each, causing parakeet to produce garbled output.

**Fix:** Post-merge adjacent VAD segments: combine if gap < 1s or if
the accumulated segment is shorter than 3s. This produces 2 merged
segments instead of 5 tiny ones, with correct transcription.

### VAD stitching matches whisper.cpp quality

whisper.cpp stitches VAD segments into one contiguous buffer with 0.1s
silence gaps, builds a mapping table, processes as one audio stream,
then remaps timestamps. This is fundamentally better than independent
per-slice processing because the decoder sees continuous audio context.

We now do the same for non-whisper backends: stitch → single
`transcribe()` call → remap. Tested on 89s and 227s audio — no
boundary artifacts, correct timestamps throughout.

### Backend-specific audio length limits

| Backend | Mel length | Hard limit? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| whisper | 3000 frames (30s) | Yes | Pads to exactly 3000 frames |
| voxtral 3B | 3000 frames (30s) | Yes | `T_mel = 3000` hardcoded |
| voxtral4b | variable | No | Causal encoder, streams |
| qwen3 | variable | No | Chunked conv subsampler |
| parakeet | variable | No | O(T²) attention, ~5min practical limit |
| canary | variable | No | O(T²) attention, ~5min practical limit |
| cohere | variable | No | O(T²) attention, ~5min practical limit |
| granite | variable | No | Block-local attention (ctx=200), any length |

For whisper and voxtral 3B, 30s chunking is mandatory. For the rest,
longer chunks work but hit O(T²) memory walls. VAD stitching helps by
removing silence (shorter effective audio), and the max-chunk split
prevents OOM on very long continuous speech.

### Qwen3 forced aligner leading-silence issue

The qwen3 forced aligner assigns timestamps starting from 0 even when
audio has leading silence. On the user's 227s JavaScript tutorial with
~3s of leading silence, the first word was stamped at 0.24s instead
of ~3.2s. With VAD stitching, the silence is removed before alignment,
fixing the issue.

**Lesson:** The forced aligner only works well when the audio starts
with speech. Always use VAD to trim silence before alignment.

### Qwen3 forced aligner monotonicity

The reference implementation (`qwen3_forced_aligner.py`) has a
`fix_timestamp()` function using longest-increasing-subsequence (LIS)
to correct non-monotonic timestamps. We use a simpler forward clamp
(each timestamp >= previous). This handles most cases but may miss
complex inversions. Parakeet's native TDT timestamps are always
better when available.

### CrispASR vs voxtral.c: 3.8× faster on CPU

Direct same-hardware comparison (Xeon 4-core, no GPU) on jfk.wav:
- voxtral.c (OpenBLAS): 11m 0s (encoder 220s, decoder 2660ms/step)
- CrispASR (ggml): 2m 52s
- Speedup: 3.8×, attributable to ggml's optimised matmul kernels

### Susurrus architecture insights

Susurrus (CrispStrobe's Python ASR tool) uses:
- `vad_filter=True` hardcoded in faster-whisper (always on)
- 25-minute chunks with 2s overlap for voxtral local
- GPU memory explicitly freed between chunks (`torch.cuda.empty_cache`)
- Generator-based segment yielding (streaming/incremental)

**Lesson:** VAD should be the default, not an opt-in. 30s chunks are
too conservative for most models; 5-10 minutes is practical for
variable-length backends on 16GB VRAM.

### wav2vec2-base: post-norm vs pre-norm (the silent architecture trap)

wav2vec2-base models (`do_stable_layer_norm=False`) use **post-norm**
transformer layers: `attention → residual_add → LayerNorm → FFN →
residual_add → LayerNorm`. wav2vec2-large models
(`do_stable_layer_norm=True`) use **pre-norm**: `LayerNorm → attention →
residual_add → LayerNorm → FFN → residual_add`.

Our initial implementation only had pre-norm (matching the large XLSR
model we first ported). Running a base model through pre-norm produces
all-identical outputs at every time position — the encoder loses
positional information and the CTC decoder outputs the same character
(argmax=24 = "b") at every frame.

**Symptoms:** Output is a single character repeated, or empty text.
All positions have the same argmax.

**Root cause debugging protocol:**
1. Get HF reference intermediates (CNN out, feature projection, encoder
   out, logits argmax) — these are ground truth.
2. Add debug fprintf to C++ at each stage boundary.
3. Compare stage by stage — CNN matched, feature projection matched,
   but logits diverged completely.
4. The argmax pattern `[24,24,24,24,...]` (all same) immediately points
   to an encoder bug that collapses positional information.
5. Check `do_stable_layer_norm` in the HF config — it controls the
   norm ordering and is the first thing to verify when porting a new
   wav2vec2 variant.

**Second bug:** CTC blank token. `config.pad_token_id=1` (BOS) in base
models, but CTC greedy decoding must skip vocab index 0 (`<pad>`) which
is the actual CTC blank. The converter now hardcodes blank=0.

**Lesson:** When porting a model architecture, always check for
configuration flags that change the graph topology (norm ordering,
activation type, bias presence). These are silent — the model loads
and runs without errors, but produces garbage. A debug copy of the
forward pass (`wav2vec2-ggml-debug.cpp`) with fprintf at each stage
boundary is kept for future model variant debugging.

## CLI ↔ library DRY refactor (April 2026)

v0.4.4–v0.4.8 moved every non-presentation CLI concern into `src/`
behind the shared C-ABI. Below are the lessons from the five-release
cycle — things worth remembering the next time a helper turns out to
be shared across more consumers than its location suggests.

### File names are claims; check them periodically

`examples/cli/crispasr_dart_helpers.cpp` started as Dart-only in
0.2.0 but by 0.4.0 it was the common FFI surface consumed by the CLI,
Dart, Python, and Rust. The file name was a documentation bug for
four releases. The first move (`crispasr_c_api.cpp` + updated header
comment) was pure churn and should have been done earlier. An
occasional pass over file/function names vs actual callers is worth
doing.

### Header basename clashes surface late

`src/crispasr_vad.h` and `examples/cli/crispasr_vad.h` coexisted
without error until the CLI source that `#include "crispasr_vad.h"`
happened to compile against the `src/` version (because the whisper
target is `target_include_directories(... PUBLIC .)`) — producing a
cryptic type mismatch with the CLI's `whisper_params` usage. Renaming
the CLI headers to `*_cli.h` (vad/diarize/lid/model_mgr/aligner) is
the clean fix; guards like `-I` ordering are fragile.

### Function-name collisions are worse than symbol collisions

Both `src/crispasr_lid.cpp` and `examples/cli/crispasr_lid.cpp`
defined `crispasr_detect_language(...)` as non-member C++ functions.
Different argument types → different mangled names → the linker is
happy. But any caller looking at `crispasr_detect_language(samples,
n, params)` has no idea which one it's getting. The safer pattern is
to suffix all CLI-shim symbols (`crispasr_detect_language_cli`,
`crispasr_apply_diarize`, etc.) so the call sites themselves signal
which layer they belong to.

### Backwards-compat aliases for renamed C-ABI symbols

When we renamed `crispasr_dart_helpers_version()` to
`crispasr_c_api_version()`, 0.4.x-era binaries already existed that
probed the old name. The library now exports both — the new function
is canonical, the old one is a 2-line thunk that calls it. A TODO in
source marks the removal after the next major version. The Dart
smoke test asserts **both** resolve and return the same value, so
we can't accidentally drop the alias early.

### POD ABI structs: be explicit about padding

`crispasr_vad_abi_opts` is `float + 5×int32` = 24 bytes. Clean on
64-bit with no padding. `crispasr_diarize_seg_abi` would have been
`int64 + int64 + int32` = 20 bytes with 4 bytes of trailing padding
on 64-bit — so we added an explicit `int32_t _pad` and documented
the 24-byte size so Dart/Python/Rust bindings can allocate the
struct by hand. Always check `sizeof` on both 32- and 64-bit
platforms when promoting a struct to the ABI.

### Policy stays in the CLI; algorithms go to the library

Every CLI shim follows the same pattern:
- **CLI-only (stays in `examples/cli/*_cli.{h,cpp}`)**: auto-download
  from `~/.cache/crispasr`, `isatty()` / TTY prompts,
  `sherpa-onnx` subprocess spawn, CLI-specific types like
  `whisper_params` / `crispasr_segment` / `crispasr_word`.
- **Library (goes to `src/*.{h,cpp}`)**: the actual algorithm —
  Silero VAD + stitching, diarize methods, whisper encode for LID,
  canary-CTC Viterbi, the model registry table, the WinHTTP/curl
  download helper.

This line is obvious in hindsight but we kept crossing it early on.
Rule of thumb: if a wrapper consumer (Python / Rust / Flutter app)
could want the function too, it belongs in the library.

### Rust CStr + static buffers for string-returning C-ABI

For the registry lookup (`crispasr_registry_lookup_abi`) we went
with caller-allocated output buffers (`out_filename`, `out_url`,
`out_size` as `char* + int cap`) rather than returning an opaque
handle with accessors. Reasons:
- Single call rather than 5 round-trips to Python/Dart
- No lifetime management for the wrappers
- Registry strings are small (URL up to ~256 chars), so a fixed
  2 KB stack buffer is fine
- Easy to detect "buffer too small" (return code 2) and retry

For `crispasr_align_words_abi` we did the opposite — one result can
contain hundreds of words, each a variable-length string, so we
kept the `session_result`-style handle + accessors pattern. Choice
of pattern depends on how bounded the output is.

### A Dart smoke test that only checks `lib.lookup()` catches 90% of binding drift

`flutter/crispasr/test/bindings_smoke_test.dart` just resolves every
C-ABI symbol by name. It takes 50 ms to run, needs no audio, and
catches: symbol rename typos, missing `CA_EXPORT`, new backend
dropping a target from `target_link_libraries(whisper PUBLIC ...)`,
and stale `.so`/`.dylib` on the test machine. Ran it after every
release in this cycle; caught one typo that would've shipped.

### Rust FFI: C++ exceptions abort the process

The old `CrispASR` Rust API (wrapping `whisper_full()` directly) crashes
with "Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions" because whisper.cpp's C++
code can throw exceptions (ggml assertion failures, `std::bad_alloc`).
Rust's `extern "C"` FFI boundary treats C++ exceptions as undefined
behavior — they unwind through Rust stack frames and trigger `abort()`.

The `Session` API works because `crispasr_session_transcribe()` is a
C-ABI wrapper implemented in C++ that catches exceptions internally
and returns error codes. The old `whisper_full()` path has no such
wrapper.

**Lesson:** All C-ABI functions exposed to Rust/Dart/Python must wrap
their body in `try { ... } catch (...) { return error_code; }`. The
Session API does this by design. The legacy whisper-direct functions
(`whisper_full`, `whisper_init_from_file_with_params`) do not. We mark
the old Rust `CrispASR` struct as deprecated in favor of `Session`.

### split-on-punct proportional fallback: the silent accuracy killer

When `--split-on-punct` was used without `-ml N`, the display segment
builder checked `seg.words.empty() || max_len == 0` and took the
proportional interpolation path — even when the backend (parakeet)
had produced accurate word-level timestamps. The proportional path
estimates sentence boundaries by character position ratio, which can
be off by 1+ seconds.

**Symptoms:** Sentence start/end times don't match the actual speech.
A sentence ending with "code." at 6.3s shows as ending at 7.3s.

**Root cause:** `max_len == 0` (the default when `-ml` isn't passed)
was treated as "no word packing" even though `split_on_punct` DOES
need word-level timestamps for accurate splitting.

**Fix:** `(max_len == 0 && !split_on_punct)` — only skip word packing
when neither max_len nor split_on_punct is requested.

**Second bug in the same path:** The flush happened AFTER updating
`cur.t1 = w.t1`, so the flushed sentence included the NEXT word's
end time. Moved flush to before the update.

**Lesson:** When two features interact (max_len + split_on_punct),
test all four combinations: (0,false), (0,true), (N,false), (N,true).
The (0,true) case was never tested and silently degraded accuracy.

### GLM-ASR-Nano: partial RoPE is non-negotiable

GLM-ASR-Nano uses `partial_rotary_factor = 0.5`, meaning RoPE is
applied to only the first half of each attention head's dimensions
(32 out of 64). Applying full RoPE (to all 64 dims) produces encoder
outputs that are ~30% off from the reference — close enough to load
and run, but too divergent for correct transcription.

**Implementation:** Split Q/K tensors along head_dim via `ggml_view_3d`,
apply `ggml_rope_ext` to the first-half view, concatenate back with
`ggml_concat`. This can't use `encoder_self_attn()` (which assumes
full RoPE), so the attention is implemented inline.

**Lesson:** Always check `partial_rotary_factor` in the config before
using RoPE helpers. If it's not 1.0, split-apply-concat is required.
The same pattern appears in Gemma, Phi, and other recent architectures.

### FFT size must be power of 2 for radix-2

`core_mel::compute()` calls `fft(data, n_fft, output)` where `n_fft`
may not be a power of 2 (whisper uses 400). A radix-2 Cooley-Tukey
FFT requires power-of-2 input — passing 400 corrupts memory via
bit-reversal permutation on a non-power-of-2 array.

**Fix:** Zero-pad to the next power of 2 (400→512) inside the FFT
function, then truncate the output back to N bins.

### KV cache: no_alloc=true is mandatory for scheduler

The `ggml_backend_sched` requires all tensor contexts referenced in
the graph to have `no_alloc=true`. Creating the KV cache context with
`no_alloc=false` + `ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors()` causes an
assertion failure in `ggml_backend_sched_alloc_graph`.

**Fix:** Use `no_alloc=true` context + manual `ggml_backend_alloc_buffer`
+ `ggml_backend_tensor_alloc` (matching voxtral's pattern). Also call
`ggml_backend_sched_set_tensor_backend` for KV tensors before graph
allocation.

## Windows / MSVC portability (April 2026)

### `M_PI` is not defined on MSVC by default

`<cmath>` under MSVC does not expose `M_PI` unless `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`
is `#define`d *before* the header is included. POSIX toolchains
(glibc, libc++ on macOS) leak it through by default, so code that
relies on `M_PI` builds cleanly on Linux and macOS and then fails on
Windows with:

```
error C2065: 'M_PI': undeclared identifier
```

This bit `src/glm_asr.cpp` (the Cooley-Tukey FFT butterfly uses
`-2 * M_PI / len`) — the rest of the codebase had already standardised
on `core/mel.h`'s FFT helpers, which avoid `M_PI` internally, so the
issue was invisible until glm-asr landed its own inline FFT.

**Fix pattern, applied at the very top of any TU that uses `M_PI`:**

```cpp
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <cmath>
#ifndef M_PI
#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846
#endif
```

The redundant `#ifndef` guard covers the case where someone further
down the include graph has already pulled in `<cmath>` before the
define (harmless on POSIX; a no-op on MSVC where the guard fires).

**Lesson:** Every new `src/` TU that touches trigonometry on its own
(rather than going through `core/mel.h`) needs this three-line
preamble. Consider banning direct `M_PI` use in code review — pulling
FFT/trig through `core_mel` is portable for free.

### Vulkan first-run latency: the 13-second "Vulkan is slow" illusion

Initial measurement on a hybrid-GPU laptop (Intel Iris Xe + NVIDIA
RTX A1000) reported Vulkan at **0.5× realtime** on parakeet Q4_K /
jfk.wav vs CUDA at 10× RT — a 20× gap that looked like Vulkan being
hopeless for ASR. Diagnosis was initially directed at device
selection (maybe it's on the Intel iGPU?). **Wrong.**

`ggml_backend_init_best()` already prefers `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU`
over `_IGPU` — the NVIDIA dGPU was correctly selected. The real cost
was **first-run pipeline compilation**: SPIR-V → native GPU ISA for
~50-100 compute pipelines happens lazily on first dispatch, and
ggml-vulkan passed `VK_NULL_HANDLE` to every
`device->device.createComputePipeline(…)` call, meaning **no
VkPipelineCache was used at all**. Subsequent runs only appeared
"fast" because the NVIDIA driver has its own per-shader disk cache
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\GLCache`) that catches the miss one level
down. Wipe that cache and every Vulkan run is 13+ seconds again,
permanently.

**Fix** (`ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp`): added a persistent
`vk::PipelineCache` on `vk_device_struct`, keyed by
`vendor:device:driverVersion`, stored under `$LOCALAPPDATA\ggml\vulkan_pipeline_cache\`
(Windows) / `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ggml/vulkan_pipeline_cache/` (Linux) /
`~/Library/Caches/ggml/vulkan_pipeline_cache/` (macOS). Loaded at
device init, passed to every `createComputePipeline` call, flushed
to disk every 4 new pipelines (counter on the device struct).

Flushing in the destructor alone is not sufficient on Windows: we
call `_Exit(0)` from the CLI (see "Process exit hang" memory entry)
to sidestep a Vulkan static-destructor stall, which also bypasses
`~vk_device_struct()`. Periodic save inside
`ggml_pipeline_request_descriptor_sets` / pipeline-creation covers
this without any new public API.

**Results** (parakeet Q4_K / jfk.wav, 11 s audio, same laptop):

| Scenario | Transcribe time | RTFx |
|---|---:|---:|
| Vulkan cold (no caches) | 13.69 s | 0.8× |
| Vulkan, only our ggml cache warm (NVIDIA GLCache wiped) | **1.34 s** | **8.2×** |
| Vulkan, both caches warm | **0.64 s** | **17.1×** |
| CUDA baseline | 1.21 s | 9.1× |

Warm Vulkan now **beats** CUDA on this laptop (0.64 s vs 1.21 s —
likely because NV_coopmat2 matmul kernels in ggml-vulkan are
better-tuned for this shape than the CUDA path's `cublasGemmEx`
call), and cold-run latency is now a one-time cost per install
rather than per run. Disable via `GGML_VK_DISABLE_PIPELINE_CACHE=1`;
inspect with `GGML_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_DEBUG=1`.

**Lessons:**

1. When benchmarking GPU backends, **always run the target path
   twice** and report both cold and warm numbers. "Vulkan is 20×
   slower" was a first-run artifact that would have survived code
   review unchanged if we'd trusted the single measurement.
2. Shader native-compilation caching is **not** a driver-only
   concern. Every Vulkan application that loads the same shaders
   repeatedly should pass a `VkPipelineCache` to
   `vkCreateComputePipelines` / `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` and
   persist it across runs. ggml-vulkan didn't, upstream — our
   patch should probably be submitted.
3. `_Exit()` bypasses destructors. Any caching scheme that only
   flushes in a destructor will silently lose its work on Windows
   builds that call `_Exit`. Periodic incremental save from the
   hot path (throttled) is a simple workaround that doesn't need
   new shutdown hooks.

### Issue #12 (prebuilt binary: silent exit after "using cached")

Reported against a prebuilt release binary on Windows 11 / Intel i3
with no NVIDIA GPU. User sees `crispasr: using cached …` and then
the process returns to the shell prompt — no `parakeet: vocab=…`,
no error, no crash dialog.

**Could not reproduce** at HEAD with a fresh local build on Windows
11 (with NVIDIA GPU). The same `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-q4_k` command
transcribes correctly. Deliberately-corrupt cache files (1 KB
truncated, empty) all produce **loud** errors:

```
gguf_init_from_file_ptr: failed to read key-value pairs
core_gguf: failed to open '…' for metadata read
parakeet: failed to load '…'
crispasr[parakeet]: failed to load model '…'
crispasr: error: failed to initialise backend 'parakeet'
```

with exit code 13. So a partial-download cache file is not the cause.

**The giveaway in the reporter's log:** no `ggml_cuda_init: …` line,
which we always print at startup as long as `ggml-cuda.dll` loads
successfully (regardless of `--no-gpu`). On a machine with no
NVIDIA driver installed, `ggml-cuda.dll` depends transitively on
`cudart64_*.dll` / `cublas64_*.dll`. If those are missing, Windows
fails the DLL load. The backend registry might still swallow the
error and let the exe run on CPU — but depending on the loader
state, a later *deferred-bind* resolve can exit the process with
code `0xc0000135` / `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` with no stderr output at
all. That matches the reporter's symptom.

**Remediations to consider (none shipped yet):**
1. Ship a **CPU-only** prebuilt alongside the CUDA build for users
   without NVIDIA drivers. `build-windows.bat -DGGML_CUDA=OFF`
   produces a binary with no CUDA dependency.
2. Delay-load `ggml-cuda.dll` via `/DELAYLOAD:ggml-cuda.dll` + a
   `__HrLoadAllImportsForDll` guard, so a missing runtime falls
   back to CPU instead of exiting the process.
3. At startup, call `SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS)` and log
   `GetLastError()` on any DLL resolve failure so the user sees
   *why* the process stopped.
4. Add a `--diagnose` subcommand that prints loaded backends,
   device list, and cache dir — one-line "is my install broken"
   check for end-users.

**Lesson:** A Windows process can exit **completely silently**
when a delay-loaded or transitively-required DLL is missing. Any
"prints one line then disappears" bug report on Windows should
first be diagnosed by (a) checking Event Viewer →
`Application` for a `Faulting module name` crash log, and (b)
running the binary against `Dependencies.exe` or
`dumpbin /dependents` to find the missing import. The codebase
itself is usually fine.

## Kyutai STT: causal padding, interleaved RoPE, and codec-based ASR

### Causal (left-only) padding in conv1d

moshi/Mimi uses `StreamingConv1d` which prepends
`pad_left = kernel_size - stride` zeros to the LEFT before conv1d with
padding=0. Standard symmetric padding produces completely wrong Mimi
encoder output — the SEANet outputs are numerically different and the
RVQ codes cascade to garbage.

**Fix:** `ggml_pad_ext(x, pad_left, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)` before
`ggml_conv_1d(weight, x, stride, 0, 1)`. After this fix, SEANet output
was bit-perfect vs the official Python Mimi encoder.

### Interleaved vs NEOX RoPE

Kyutai models use **interleaved** RoPE (`[r0,i0,r1,i1,...]`), which is
`GGML_ROPE_TYPE_NORMAL = 0`. Not the NEOX layout (`[r0,r1,...,i0,i1,...]`)
used by Llama/Mistral/Qwen. Using the wrong RoPE type makes the encoder
transformer output diverge (max diff 0.07) and the LM produce garbage.

**Lesson:** Always check `rope.interleave` in the Python source. The two
layouts are **not** compatible — there's no graceful degradation, just
completely wrong output.

### Initial token IDs

The STT LM uses `text_card` (8000) as the initial text token and `card`
(2048) as the initial audio token — NOT the padding ID (3). These are
"start-of-sequence" tokens at the end of the vocabulary. The moshi.cpp
code: `text_initial_token_id = config.text_card; initial_token_id = config.card`.

### Stage-by-stage diff protocol (applied)

1. SEANet: bit-perfect after causal padding fix (max diff = 0.000000)
2. Encoder transformer: bit-perfect after RoPE + causal mask fix
3. RVQ codes: 99.3% match (100% codebook-0, FP residual drift on rest)
4. LM: correct "And so, my fellow Americans..." after all fixes

The causal padding bug was invisible at the architecture level — the
shapes were correct, the model ran without errors, but every single
output value was wrong. Only the diff-test protocol caught it.
