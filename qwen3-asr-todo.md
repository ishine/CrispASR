> **STATUS (2026-04-09): ✅ COMPLETE.** Full pipeline shipped. BPE tokenizer,
> flash-attn, F16 KV cache, GPU auto-detect, word timestamps via CTC aligner,
> SRT/VTT output, HF release shipped. Remaining: VAD for long audio,
> temperature/sampling, streaming. See `TODO.md` for current task list.

Hybrid plan (option A) confirmed 2026-04-08. Reuses our existing whisper
mel + parakeet-style 2D subsampler + new Qwen3 LLM forward. Reference
implementation: github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp (MIT) — used for
architecture findings, **not** vendored.

## Architecture (verified against safetensors shapes)

### Audio tower — 2D-conv subsampler + Whisper-block body
- `conv2d1`: (480, 1, 3, 3)   — Conv2D, treats mel spec as 1×128×T image
- `conv2d2`: (480, 480, 3, 3)
- `conv2d3`: (480, 480, 3, 3)  — three stride-2 freq subsamplings (128→64→32→16)
- `conv_out`: linear (7680 → 896) where 7680 = 480 ch × 16 freq bins
- 18 × encoder block, each:
  - pre-LN `self_attn_layer_norm` (weight + bias)
  - `self_attn`: q/k/v/out_proj (896→896) **with biases** (Whisper-style)
  - 14 heads × 64 head_dim = 896
  - pre-LN `final_layer_norm` (weight + bias)
  - FFN: `fc1` (896→3584) GELU `fc2` (3584→896) **with biases**
- `ln_post` (896, weight+bias) — final norm
- Projector head:
  - `proj1` (896→896) + bias  → GELU
  - `proj2` (896→1024) + bias → output frames matching LLM hidden

**Positional embedding** is sinusoidal, computed at runtime via the Whisper
formula (`SinusoidsPositionEmbedding` class):
```
log_inc = log(10000) / (C/2 - 1)
inv_t   = exp(-log_inc * arange(C/2))
pe      = concat(sin(t*inv_t), cos(t*inv_t)) along channel
```
Shape `(max_pos, 896)` where max_pos comes from `n_window_infer=800`.
NOT stored in safetensors — we compute it on the C++ side identically.

**Chunked input pipeline (verified against reference dump 2026-04-08):**
1. Mel `(128, T)` is split along time into chunks of size `n_window*2 = 100`.
2. Chunks are batched and unsqueezed: `(num_chunks, 1, 128, 100)`.
3. Each chunk runs through `conv2d1/2/3` + GELU independently → `(num_chunks, 480, 16, 13)`.
4. Permute + flatten freq: `(num_chunks, 13, 480*16=7680)` → `conv_out` linear → `(num_chunks, 13, 896)`.
5. **Add positional embedding** sliced to T_chunk_out=13.
6. Mask out padding: flatten valid positions across chunks → `(N_total, 896)` where
   `N_total = sum(aftercnn_lens)` (e.g. 143 for 11s of jfk audio).

**Chunked self-attention via `cu_seqlens`:** the flat `(N_total, 896)` is fed
through 18 encoder layers, each of which applies **windowed attention**: positions
are grouped by `cu_seqlens` (cumulative chunk lengths) and attention only happens
within each window. Window size after CNN is
`window_aftercnn = padded_T_after_cnn * (n_window_infer // (n_window*2))`.
For our case `padded_T_after_cnn=13, n_window_infer=800, n_window=50` → window=104.
**Standard full self-attention will produce wrong output.** This is the
trickiest part of the C++ port.

### Text decoder — stock Qwen3 0.6B (28 layers)
- hidden=1024, 16 heads, **8 KV heads (GQA)**, head_dim=128
- `embed_tokens` (151936, 1024)
- per layer:
  - `input_layernorm` (RMSNorm, weight only)
  - `self_attn`: q_proj (2048, 1024), k_proj (1024, 1024), v_proj (1024, 1024),
    o_proj (1024, 2048), **no biases**
  - `q_norm`, `k_norm` (128,) — Qwen3-specific RMSNorm on per-head Q/K
  - `post_attention_layernorm` (RMSNorm)
  - `mlp`: gate_proj (3072, 1024), up_proj (3072, 1024), down_proj (1024, 3072)
    SwiGLU, no biases
- `model.norm` (RMSNorm)
- `lm_head` (151936, 1024) — stored separately even though config says tied
- RoPE θ=1e6, head_dim=128
- **mrope:** config has `mrope_interleaved` with `mrope_section=[24,20,20]`,
  but reference impl ignores mrope and uses standard 1D RoPE. We do the
  same as a v1 simplification — verify against reference output before
  shipping.

### Audio injection
- ChatML prompt:
  `<|im_start|>system\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<|audio_start|><|audio_pad|>×N<|audio_end|><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n`
- The N `<|audio_pad|>` (151676) tokens get their token-embedding row
  replaced by the N projector output frames (masked_scatter pattern)
- N = number of frames out of the encoder = `(T_mel - pad) / 8` after
  the 3 stride-2 freq convs (which also subsample T by 8?)
- Special tokens: audio_start=151669, audio_end=151670, audio_pad=151676,
  eos=151645, pad=151643

## Work breakdown

### Done
- [x] Download Qwen3-ASR-0.6B safetensors (1.87 GB) → `/tmp/qwen3-asr-inspect/`
- [x] Reverse-engineer architecture from config + shapes
- [x] Read upstream reference impl (predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp), confirmed
      this plan is implementable

### Step 1 — Converter (this session)
- [ ] `models/convert-qwen3-asr-to-gguf.py` in our converter style
      (per-arch namespace `qwen3asr.*`, F16/F32 split via `is_f32_tensor`,
      no llama.cpp gguf-py dependency, no inline quantisation — defer to
      `cohere-quantize`)
- [ ] Tensor name map derived from upstream + verified against actual keys
- [ ] Run on the downloaded weights, produce `qwen3-asr-0.6b.gguf` (~1.5 GB F16)
- [ ] Verify tensor count matches expectation (612 stored → ~610 mapped)

### Step 2 — Encoder ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)
- [x] `src/qwen3_asr.{h,cpp}` — full audio encoder graph builder
- [x] Sinusoidal pos embed precomputed at load time (Whisper formula)
- [x] Conv front-end + 18 Whisper-style pre-LN blocks + ln_post + proj1 + GELU + proj2
- [x] **Diff test on jfk.wav: max abs diff 1.43e-4, mean 7.31e-6, per-row cosine
      sim mean=1.000000 min=0.999999** — F16 numerical precision

#### Notable bugs fixed during Stage 2:
1. **`ggml_permute` semantics** (Stage 1): `permute(t, p0, p1, p2, p3)` means
   "source axis i goes to NEW position p_i", NOT "new axis i comes from source
   axis p_i". I had it backwards. Confirmed by reading ggml.c:3772 (`ne[axis0]
   = a->ne[0]`). Fixed by swapping permute args from (1,2,0,3) to (2,0,1,3)
   for the conv flatten step.
2. **PyTorch conv hooks fire pre-GELU**: `conv1_out.npy` etc. are PRE-gelu
   captures (the hook is on the `nn.Conv2d` module, GELU is applied externally
   via `F.gelu(self.conv2d1(chunk))`). Needed to compare C++ pre-gelu against
   the dumps, not C++ post-gelu.
3. **`cu_seqlens` is GPU-only**: `eager_attention_forward` (used on CPU)
   IGNORES `cu_seqlens` and does standard full self-attention with
   `attention_mask=None`. The windowed attention is only used by
   FlashAttention2 on GPU. **The C++ implementation should NOT apply windowed
   masking on CPU** — it just uses zero mask. Critical: this also means a
   future GPU/flash-attn variant would need explicit windowing, but the
   reference produces full-attention output for our diff target.

### Step 3 — Qwen3 LLM forward ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)
- [x] `qwen3_asr_build_graph_llm()` in `src/qwen3_asr.cpp`
- [x] GQA via `ggml_repeat_4d` (insert singleton, repeat 2×, reshape) — turns
      (head_dim, n_kv=8, T) into (head_dim, n_q=16, T) with each KV head
      duplicated to its corresponding 2 Q heads
- [x] Q-norm/K-norm: `ggml_rms_norm` along head_dim axis × per-head_dim weight
- [x] SwiGLU FFN: `down(silu(gate(x)) * up(x))`
- [x] NEOX-style RoPE θ=1e6 via `ggml_rope_ext` with `GGML_ROPE_TYPE_NEOX`
- [x] Causal mask + softmax with attention scaling
- [x] Token embedding lookup via `ggml_get_rows`
- [x] **Diff test on 9-token text prompt:**
      - max abs logit diff: 3.29e-2
      - mean abs diff: 4.38e-3
      - per-position cosine sim mean=0.999999 min=0.999996
      - **top-1 match: 9/9** (every position picks identical argmax token to PyTorch)
- [x] mrope sidestepped: for text-only input, mrope sections [24,20,20] all
      receive identical position_ids → reduces to standard 1D RoPE. The
      audio-injection path will need re-evaluation if mrope diverges, but for
      pure-text smoke test the simpler RoPE matches reference perfectly.

#### Bugs fixed
- **Attention output width**: each Q has 16 heads × 128 head_dim = 2048,
  NOT d_model=1024. The o_proj is (2048→1024), so the attention output is
  reshaped to (2048, T) before o_proj, then o_proj reduces to (1024, T).
  I had incorrectly used `ggml_reshape_2d(attn, d, T)` (= 1024 width).
  Fixed via `ggml_reshape_2d(attn, hd*n_q, T)`.

### Step 4 — Audio injection + end-to-end ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)
- [x] `qwen3_asr_embed_tokens()` — token-embed lookup helper exposing the
      backend `get_rows` to callers
- [x] `qwen3_asr_run_llm_from_embeds()` — LLM forward starting from a
      precomputed `(d, T)` embeddings buffer instead of token IDs
- [x] Refactored the LLM graph into a shared `qwen3_asr_build_llm_body()`
      called by both the ids-input and embeds-input variants
- [x] `examples/qwen3-asr-test-trace/main.cpp` — end-to-end test that loads
      a Python-dumped trace (input_ids + audio_pad_pos + reference logits +
      reference generated ids), runs encoder → embed → splice → LLM forward
      → greedy decode (no KV cache, full forward each step), and verifies
      the C++ output matches the Python wrapper.
- [x] **End-to-end PASS on jfk.wav:**
      - Next-token logits cosine sim 0.999997, argmax matches (token 11528=" And")
      - Greedy decode generated 30 tokens ending with EOS
      - **All 26 reference tokens reproduced contiguously** at gen offset 3
      - The 3 leading tokens are the language-detection markers that the
        Python wrapper strips before returning text — they ARE in the
        actual model output, just hidden by the wrapper.
      - Decoded transcript: "And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what
        your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."
- [ ] BPE tokeniser for the prompt (deferred — for the Stage-5 CLI we can
      either ship a small Python helper that pre-tokenises or implement BPE
      from `tokenizer.ggml.tokens` + `tokenizer.ggml.merges` in C++)

### Step 5 — KV cache, CLI, integration

#### KV cache ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)
- [x] Persistent F32 KV cache `(head_dim=128, max_ctx, n_kv=8, n_layers=28)`
      allocated to backend, lives on `qwen3_asr_context`
- [x] `qwen3_asr_kv_init()` / `qwen3_asr_kv_reset()` lifecycle
- [x] `build_graph_llm_kv()` shared between prefill (n_past=0, n_tokens=T)
      and incremental decode (n_past>0, n_tokens=1):
      - Writes new K/V to cache view at offset `il*nb[3] + n_past*nb[1]`
      - Reads full history `(hd, n_past+T, n_kv)` for attention
      - Causal mask shape `(Lk, T)` constructed CPU-side per call
- [x] `qwen3_asr_run_llm_kv()` C API with auto n_past tracking
- [x] **Trace test PASS with KV cache**: same 26/26 token match
- [x] **Performance on jfk.wav (11s audio)**:
      - prefill 158 tokens: 3.84 s
      - decode 29 tokens: 4.81 s = **165.8 ms/token**
      - end-to-end: ~9 s (was ~120 s without cache → **~25× decode speedup**)
- [x] KV cache: 896 MiB at max_ctx=4096 in F32. F16 cache (next step) would
      cut this in half.

#### CLI ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)
- [x] Mel filterbank baked into GGUF via converter (`audio.mel_filters` =
      WhisperFeatureExtractor.mel_filters in (n_freqs=201, n_mels=128) layout,
      `audio.mel_window` = periodic Hann of length 400)
- [x] `qwen3_asr_compute_mel()` C API: STFT + mel projection + log10 +
      max-8dB clip + (x+4)/4 normalization, matching WhisperFeatureExtractor
- [x] Inline FFT (Cooley-Tukey + DFT leaves) handles non-power-of-2 n_fft=400
- [x] **Mel diff vs Python reference: max abs 2.2e-2, mean 3.2e-6** (F16 noise)
- [x] BPE tokeniser **sidestepped**: the chat-template prompt is fixed except
      for the audio_pad count, so token IDs are hardcoded in `build_prompt_ids()`
- [x] GPT-2 byte-decoder for vocab strings → UTF-8 transcript text
- [x] Tiny WAV reader (16-bit PCM, mono or stereo→mono mixdown, 16 kHz only)
- [x] `examples/qwen3-asr-main/main.cpp` (~280 LOC) ties everything together
- [x] **End-to-end on samples/jfk.wav (4 threads, F32 weights):**
      - mel:     250 ms
      - encoder: 2660 ms
      - prefill: 3032 ms
      - decode:  4391 ms (29 tokens, 151 ms/token)
      - **total: 10.3 s for 11 s of audio**
      - Output: "And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country
        can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."
- [x] Last-token-only lm_head optimization (~25% prefill speedup)
- [x] `qwen3_asr_token_text()` C API for vocab string lookup

#### Bugs fixed during Stage 5
1. **lm_head reshape** (during refactor): forgot the `T > 1` guard around the
   view-2d slice. Trivial.
2. **Mel filterbank orientation**: WhisperFeatureExtractor.mel_filters is
   shape `(n_freqs, n_mels)` not `(n_mels, n_freqs)`. My initial C++ access
   was transposed → max diff 1.9 in mel. Fixed.
3. **Hann window**: `np.hanning` is symmetric (divides by N-1), but
   `torch.hann_window(N, periodic=True)` (which librosa/scipy use) divides
   by N. Cosmetic ~1e-7 difference but fixed for cleanliness.

#### Stage 5b — F16 KV cache + quantization + long audio + HF release ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)

- [x] **F16 KV cache** — two-line change (`GGML_TYPE_F32 → GGML_TYPE_F16`).
      `ggml_cpy()` handles F32→F16 conversion on write into the cache view,
      `ggml_mul_mat()` consumes F16 K/V on the read path natively.
      - KV cache: 896 MiB → **448 MiB** (-50%)
      - Decode: 118 ms/tok → **102 ms/tok** at Q4_K
- [x] **Weight quantization** via the existing generic `cohere-quantize`.
      No qwen3-asr-specific changes needed — `cohere-quantize` already
      auto-skips 1D tensors, conv4D weights, anything with `norm` in the
      name, and anything without `weight` in the name (so `audio.mel_filters`
      and `audio.mel_window` are correctly preserved as F32).
      - F16 → Q8_0: 1.88 GB → 961 MB
      - F16 → Q4_K: 1.88 GB → **676 MB**
      - All quants produce correct transcripts on jfk.wav
- [x] **Long-audio support** — pad partial last chunk with zeros, the
      LLM handles the trailing silence frames naturally.
      - Tested on 89s Obama speech: 145s wall clock (~1.6× realtime),
        full multi-paragraph transcript correct, language detected as English
- [x] **lm_head last-token-only slice** — wraps the lm_head matmul in a
      `ggml_view_2d` slicing the hidden state to (d, 1) when T > 1, so
      prefill only computes 1 vocab projection instead of T. ~25% prefill
      speedup with no correctness change.
- [x] **README runtime table entry** — qwen3-asr-main added as the 6th
      runtime in the family table on the main README, plus use-case rows
      and the speech-LLM positioning paragraph
- [x] **HF release**: `cstr/qwen3-asr-0.6b-GGUF` (F16 + Q8_0 + Q4_K + README)
      published at https://huggingface.co/cstr/qwen3-asr-0.6b-GGUF
- [x] **Detected-language metadata** — surface the model's language tag
      prefix as a stderr metadata line ("language: English") instead of
      silently stripping it
- [x] **Final perf table** (jfk.wav, 11s, 4 threads, F16 KV cache):
      | weights | total | decode/tok | KV cache |
      |---------|-------|------------|----------|
      | F16     | 9.4 s | 129 ms     | 448 MiB  |
      | Q8_0    | 9.5 s | 137 ms     | 448 MiB  |
      | **Q4_K**| **8.2 s** | **102 ms** | 448 MiB |

#### Stage 5c — flash-attn on prefill + decode ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)

- [x] **`ggml_flash_attn_ext` on the cached decode path** (T = 1, no mask).
      The earlier crash was a scheduler issue: declaring an unused
      `causal_mask` input on the T=1 path → optimized away → null tensor
      lookup. Fix: declare the mask conditionally on `T > 1` in the
      graph builder, skip the corresponding `tensor_set` on the run side.
- [x] **`ggml_flash_attn_ext` on the prefill path too** (T > 1, F16 mask).
      Required rebuilding the causal mask with `ggml_fp16_t` storage and
      changing the input tensor type from F32 to F16. The mask broadcast
      rules for flash_attn are simpler than I expected: shape `(Lk, T)`
      F16 contiguous, no padding required.
- [x] **Combined results on jfk.wav (11s, Q4_K)**:
      - prefill: 3032 → 2549 → **2112 ms** (-30% cumulative across the
        decode-only and prefill flash-attn commits)
      - decode/tok: 102 → 74 → **65 ms**
      - total: 8.2 → 7.3 → **6.6 s**
- [x] **Combined results on obama_speech_16k.wav (89s, Q4_K)** — the
      win is much bigger here because attention against the 1170+ KV
      slots dominates per-token cost on long audio:
      - prefill: 24144 → 16762 ms (-30%)
      - decode/tok: 375 → 195 → **185 ms**
      - total: 145 → 98 → **89 s**  (now ~1.0× realtime, was 1.6× slower)
- [x] **Both clips faster than realtime now**, with the remaining
      bottlenecks being the encoder (constant per utterance) and the
      lm_head matmul (constant per token).

#### Stage 5d — comparison benchmark + multilingual + GGML_BLAS ✅ DONE (2026-04-08)

- [x] **Comparison benchmark vs predict-woo + Python baseline**
      (`qwen3-asr-benchmark.md`):
      - CrispASR Q4_K is **2.96× faster than predict-woo F16** on jfk.wav
        compute (6.6 s vs 19.5 s) — wins on mel (10.4×, baked filterbank
        vs runtime Slaney), encoder (1.66×, F16 KV cache + lm_head slice),
        and decode (3.13×, KV cache + flash-attn + Q4_K + last-token lm_head).
      - Python baseline (transformers + MKL) wins on long-audio prefill
        by ~10% because of MKL-tuned F32 GEMM kernels; we win on short
        audio (jfk: 10s vs 13s) where the per-call PyTorch warmup tax
        dominates.
- [x] **German / multilingual smoke test** on five Wikimedia clips
      spanning 0.7s to 207s (single words, short phrases, two
      Wikipedia article readings). CrispASR correctly detects German on
      every clip, transcribes single words and phrases perfectly, and
      handles full Wikipedia article-length transcripts including dates,
      numbers, and ISO codes.
- [x] **GGML_BLAS=ON build experiment** — negative finding documented.
      MKL via CMake's FindBLAS gives essentially no speedup (~3% on Q4_K,
      slightly slower on F16) because:
      - most matmuls go through Q4_K k-quant kernels that skip BLAS
      - F32 matmuls are batch-1, where per-call BLAS overhead eats the gain
      - ggml's CPU kernels are competitive with MKL at our matmul sizes
- [x] **PR'd predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp build fixes upstream**:
      https://github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-asr.cpp/pull/7
      Two fixes packaged together:
        1. find_package(OpenMP) + qwen3_link_openmp() helper for
           transitive OpenMP linkage (was failing with undefined
           GOMP_parallel/barrier on every Linux build)
        2. add_subdirectory(${GGML_DIR}) auto-build of the ggml submodule
           so users don't have to manually `cd ggml && cmake -B build`
           before the parent build

#### Remaining (low-priority polish)
- [ ] BPE encoder for arbitrary text input — not needed for ASR (the chat
      template prompt is fixed) but enables few-shot prompting / language
      hints in the future
- [ ] Quantize the encoder weights too (currently F32 because cohere-quantize
      auto-skips them as conv4D, but the linear projector heads could
      benefit). Would need a small filter tweak.

### Deferred to v2
- ForcedAligner-0.6B port (separate model, 1775 LOC of CTC-style alignment in
  upstream — `nfa-align` already covers the use case for now)
- mrope (only matters if we hit accuracy issues that point at long-context
  positional confusion)
- Streaming inference
