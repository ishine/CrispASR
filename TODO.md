## In-progress: GPU/performance correctness fixes

### P1. Parakeet decoder: port LSTM+Joint to ggml graphs
**Problem:** The TDT transducer decoder (LSTM predictor + Joint head) runs
entirely on CPU using raw float* loops with weights explicitly downloaded
from the backend buffer. The encoder is a proper ggml graph, but the
decoder cannot benefit from GPU at all.

**Fix:** Replace the manual LSTM step (`predictor_step`) and joint network
(`joint_step`) with small ggml graphs. Each LSTM step is a small matmul
(hidden_dim × 4*hidden_dim), so the graph overhead may not help for
per-token stepping. Two options:
- (a) Port to ggml matmul ops — gains GPU acceleration but adds per-step
  graph build/compute overhead. Best for batch mode (multiple tokens).
- (b) Keep CPU but use ggml_mul_mat with a CPU backend — at least gets
  the weights in a consistent allocation pattern.

**Risk:** The per-token LSTM stepping is inherently sequential (each step
depends on the previous hidden state). Even on GPU the latency may not
improve much. The encoder is the dominant cost anyway. Consider whether
this is worth the complexity.

**Effort:** ~200 LOC, ~1 day. Medium risk.

### P2. canary_ctc: fix single-backend scheduler (no CPU fallback)
**Problem:** `canary_ctc.cpp` line 713 creates `ggml_backend_sched` with
only 1 backend, and `backend_cpu` is aliased to the primary backend (line
676). If the primary is GPU, any unsupported op will fail instead of
falling back to CPU.

**Fix:** Add a proper 2-backend setup: `backends[0] = primary` (GPU or
CPU), `backends[1] = cpu_fallback`. Match the pattern used by canary.cpp
and cohere.cpp.

**Effort:** ~20 LOC, 15 minutes. Low risk.

### P3. qwen3_asr + voxtral: stop recreating ggml_backend_sched per call
**Problem:** Both runtimes free and recreate `ggml_backend_sched` on every
compute call (encoder, prefill, each decode step). This adds per-call
allocation overhead. The original reason was to handle different graph
sizes across stages (conv, encoder, LLM variants).

**Fix:** Create the scheduler once at init with the worst-case node budget
(the LLM prefill graph is largest). Use `ggml_backend_sched_reset()` between
calls instead of free+recreate. The max graph size can be computed once
during init by building the largest graph variant and measuring its node
count.

**Effort:** ~80 LOC per runtime, ~2 hours. Low risk.

### P4. Cohere: upgrade self-attention KV cache from F32 to F16
**Problem:** Cohere's self-attention KV cache uses F32 while canary and
the speech-LLMs use F16. This wastes 2× GPU memory and bandwidth.

**Fix:** Change `kv_k` and `kv_v` tensor types from `GGML_TYPE_F32` to
`GGML_TYPE_F16` in the KV cache allocation. Update the decoder graph to
use F16 KV reads/writes (ggml_cpy handles the F32↔F16 conversion). Flash
attention already expects F16 K/V on the CPU backend, so this may already
be partially wired.

**Risk:** F16 KV can cause minor precision loss in long decoding sequences.
Cohere's cross-attention KV is already F16 without issues, so self-attention
should be fine too.

**Effort:** ~30 LOC, 30 minutes. Low risk.

## GPU support audit (updated)

| Runtime | Encoder | Decoder/LLM | KV Cache | Mel/STFT | Backend sched |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **parakeet** | ggml ✅ | **raw CPU** ❌ (P1) | N/A (LSTM) | raw C++ | 2-backend ✅ |
| **cohere** | ggml ✅ | ggml ✅ | F32 self ⚠️ (P4), F16 cross ✅ | raw C++ (cblas mel) | 2-backend ✅ |
| **canary** | ggml ✅ | ggml ✅ | F32 self, F16 cross ✅ | raw C++ | 2-backend ✅ |
| **canary_ctc** | ggml ✅ | N/A | N/A | raw C++ | **1-backend** ❌ (P2) |
| **qwen3_asr** | ggml ✅ | ggml ✅ | F16 ✅ | raw C++ | recreated ⚠️ (P3) |
| **voxtral** | ggml ✅ | ggml ✅ | F16 ✅ | raw C++ | recreated ⚠️ (P3) |
| **wav2vec2** | old ggml ❌ | N/A | N/A | N/A | no backend API |

**Universal gap:** Mel/STFT/FFT is CPU-only in all runtimes. Each has its
own C++ FFT. This is the biggest remaining GPU opportunity but would require
porting STFT to ggml ops (ggml has no native FFT, would need a custom op
or pre-computed DFT matrix as a matmul).
