# CrispASR — TODO

Live tracker of pending work across the unified `crispasr` binary and the
shared `src/core/` infrastructure. Items marked **[next]** are the current
session's immediate targets; **[later]** are queued; **[upstream]** are
blocked on external fixes (tracked in detail in `UPSTREAM.md`).

Historical milestones and the per-model port plans are in `HISTORY.md`.
Technical deep-dives (optimisation notes, RoPE lessons, benchmark tables)
are in `LEARNINGS.md`.

## Near-term — `src/core/` Phase 0

Extraction is ~90% done for mel + ffn + gguf_loader, and attention has a
minimal pilot. The remaining pieces are documented below.

- **[next]** **`src/core/attention.h` — persistent-KV-cache variant.**
  The current `core_attn::llama_self_attn` fits voxtral 3B, which rebuilds
  Q/K/V for the full context on every forward pass. qwen3, voxtral4b, and
  granite LLM blocks use a persistent backend-buffer KV cache: K/V are
  written to a pre-allocated view at `n_past` and read back through a
  contiguous view for attention. Needs a sibling helper, e.g.
  `llama_self_attn_kv(…, kv_k, kv_v, n_past, …)`.
  Pilot on qwen3 LLM, then voxtral4b, then granite LLM. ~100 LOC helper +
  3 migrations, ~30-60 LOC saved per block.

- **[next]** **`src/core/attention.h` — Q/K norm variant for qwen3.**
  Qwen3 applies a post-projection RMSNorm to Q and K before RoPE. Add
  `q_norm_w`, `k_norm_w` optional pointers to the helper (or a separate
  variant) so qwen3's audio encoder + LLM can both use it.

- **[later]** **`src/core/attention.h` — voxtral audio encoder.**
  Different flavour: Q/V biases, **no** K bias (Whisper quirk), no RoPE.
  ~30-line sibling helper.

- **[later]** **`src/core/attention.h` — sliding-window attention.**
  voxtral4b audio encoder uses 750-token SWA. Needs a `sliding_window`
  knob and the mask has to be pre-built by the caller (or constructed
  by the helper from `sliding_window`).

- **[later]** **`src/core/attention.h` — µP scale tricks.**
  Granite uses `attention_multiplier` (0.0078125 = 1/128) as the attention
  scale instead of `1/sqrt(d)` and `residual_multiplier` (0.22) on the
  residual add. Parameterise via `Config::attn_scale` and
  `Config::residual_scale` in the helper.

- **[done]** ~~`src/core/greedy_decode.h` — unified LLM decode loop.~~
  **Done.** Header-only `core_greedy_decode::run()` with an optional
  `PreHook` callback (used by voxtral4b's streaming audio-frame-addition
  path). All 4 LLM backends migrated bit-identically: voxtral (via the
  crispasr_llm_pipeline.h template), voxtral4b (with the pre-hook for
  streaming), qwen3 (with dynamic EOS lookup via tokenize), granite
  (with EOS-filter post-step). Net: ~100 lines of duplicated decode
  loops replaced with a single templated helper.

- **[done]** ~~`src/core/mel::Params::stacked_frames`.~~ **Done
  differently.** Granite is now on `core_mel::compute` without a new
  Params knob: its normalization `v/4+1` turned out to be identical
  to `GlobalClipMax` `(v+4)/4`, and the "drop-last-if-odd + stack
  pairs into 160-mel rows" step stays in the granite wrapper as
  ~15 lines of post-processing. `core_mel` coverage is now 8/8
  non-whisper models.

- **[later]** **`cli.cpp` output writer refactor (task #4).**
  `output_json` (282 lines) and `output_wts` (120 lines) in cli.cpp
  still iterate a `whisper_context *` directly. Refactor to consume
  `const std::vector<crispasr_segment> &` so the whisper backend can
  also go through the unified writers. Unblocks the next item.

- **[later]** **`backend-whisper.cpp` wrapper (task #15).**
  Gated on the output writer refactor. When both land, the whisper code
  path in cli.cpp can dispatch through the same backend factory as
  everything else, and the `#if 0`-guarded old `whisper_params` block
  can come out.

---

## CLI + examples cleanup

- **[done]** ~~Delete the per-model `examples/*-main/` directories
  once `crispasr --backend X` has shipped.~~ **Done.** 7 user-facing
  CLIs (cohere-main, parakeet-main, canary-main, qwen3-asr-main,
  voxtral-main, voxtral4b-main, granite-main) removed. The
  `cohere-quantize.cpp` tool was rescued into
  `examples/crispasr-quantize/` as a standalone GGUF quantizer.
  Kept: `cohere-align` / `nfa-align` (standalone forced-alignment
  tools, still useful when the transcript is pre-existing) and the
  `{qwen3,voxtral}-test-*` differential fixtures.

- **[later]** `tests/CMakeLists.txt` uses `whisper-cli` as the test
  target. Keep that target name (we already preserve it) but move the
  tests over to `$<TARGET_FILE:crispasr>` once the rename has propagated.

---

## Feature parity gaps (non-whisper backends vs whisper)

The whisper backend in CrispASR is the most feature-complete. The
capability matrix in the README shows which features are missing on
each backend. High-value gaps to close:

- **[later]** **Temperature / beam search** — no non-whisper backend
  currently exposes sampling controls. `voxtral`, `voxtral4b`, `qwen3`,
  `granite` all run pure greedy decode. Hook the sampler into the
  shared `core/greedy_decode.h` helper when it lands.

- **[later]** **VAD integration in LLM backends.** qwen3 and voxtral
  currently don't chunk long audio; the dispatch layer does VAD slicing
  but the LLM models themselves pad to a fixed 30s window. Variable-
  length mel would let them handle >30s natively.

- **[later]** **Streaming transcription for voxtral4b.** The model is
  designed for realtime streaming with configurable 240ms-2.4s delay.
  Currently we run it in batch mode like the others. Exposing a
  streaming mode through the CLI is a bigger design question.

- **[later]** **Audio understanding mode for voxtral 3B.** The model
  supports Q&A over audio content, not just transcription. Needs a
  prompt template flag and a chat-style turn loop. Separate feature,
  not a strict regression.

## Per-model follow-ups

### parakeet
- **[later]** Port the TDT decoder (LSTM predictor + joint head) to
  ggml graphs so it can run on GPU. Currently pure CPU float* loops.
  Risk: per-token LSTM stepping is sequential, so GPU speedup may be
  small. Encoder is already the dominant cost.

### canary
- **[later]** Speech translation quality validation at scale.
  Currently regression-tested on German only.

### cohere
- **[later]** F32→F16 self-attention KV cache upgrade. Currently uses
  F32 where other models use F16, wasting 2× GPU memory bandwidth.
  ~30 LOC, low risk.

### qwen3 / voxtral
- **[later]** Stop recreating `ggml_backend_sched` on every compute
  call (encoder, prefill, each decode step). Create once at init with
  worst-case node budget; use `ggml_backend_sched_reset()` between
  calls. ~80 LOC per runtime.

### voxtral4b
- **[later]** Reduce right padding from 17 → 10 tokens to match the
  reference `voxtral.c` implementation.
- **[later]** SRT/VTT subtitle output (currently only plain transcript;
  CTC alignment already works via `-am`).

### granite
- **[later]** HF release of quantised GGUFs (`cstr/granite-speech-4.0-1b-GGUF`
  is still pending). Need `cohere-quantize granite-speech-1b.gguf …`
  then upload.
- **[later]** Encoder parallelisation: granite_speech is now linked
  against OpenMP but has no `#pragma omp` annotations yet. Adding
  `#pragma omp parallel for` on the per-layer encoder hot loops
  would deliver a measurable speedup on CPU but shifts the float
  reduction order, so the change needs its own regression gate
  (allow small float drift; transcript must stay correct). Encoder
  Conformer is the dominant cost today (~22.5s on jfk.wav).
- **[later]** Consider porting the per-layer CPU encoder to a single
  ggml graph like canary did.
- **[later]** Remove dead ggml graph encoder `granite_build_encoder`.

### canary_ctc (aligner)
- **[later]** Fix single-backend scheduler — currently no CPU fallback
  if the primary backend rejects an op. Match the 2-backend pattern
  from canary.cpp / cohere.cpp. ~20 LOC.

## Ground-truth diff infrastructure (new in this session)

The `tools/dump_reference.py` + `crispasr-diff` pair is the new
contributor-facing path for adding backends with confidence. Status:

- **[done]** Unified Python dumper (`tools/dump_reference.py`) with
  plug-in backend modules under `tools/reference_backends/`. Writes
  a single GGUF tensor archive per dump (not scattered `.npy` files).
- **[done]** Shared C++ diff harness (`examples/cli/crispasr_diff.{h,cpp}`)
  loading the archive via `core_gguf::load_weights` and exposing
  `compare(name, data, n)` with cosine sim / max-abs / RMS / top-1
  argmax metrics.
- **[done]** `crispasr-diff` CLI binary built alongside `crispasr`.
  Currently wires up mel-stage comparison for voxtral / voxtral4b /
  qwen3 / granite (the stages their public C API exposes). Parakeet /
  canary / cohere only have all-in-one `transcribe()` entry points so
  they're reported as unsupported.
- **[done]** Worked-example Python backend modules:
  `tools/reference_backends/qwen3.py` and `voxtral.py` are fully
  ported from the legacy `models/*-dump-*.py` scripts.
- **[done]** ~~Port `models/voxtral4b-dump-ref.py` into
  `tools/reference_backends/voxtral4b.py`~~ — done; captures mel,
  encoder_output (post-projector), t_cond, llm_argmax, generated_text.
- **[done]** ~~Port `models/granite-speech-kaggle-groundtruth.py` into
  `tools/reference_backends/granite.py`~~ — done; captures mel,
  per-layer encoder checkpoints, projector_out (Q-Former), llm_argmax,
  text. Strips the Kaggle-specific HF_TOKEN / gist-upload plumbing.
- **[later]** Expose `audio_encoder`-only and `run_llm_kv`-only
  standalone entry points in `parakeet` / `canary` / `cohere` C headers
  so `crispasr-diff` can do stage-by-stage comparison for them too
  (currently the encoder/decoder is entangled with the full transcribe).
- **[later]** Migrate `examples/{qwen3,voxtral}-test-*/main.cpp`
  drivers to load their reference data from a crispasr-diff GGUF
  archive via `crispasr_diff::Ref` instead of the inline NPY parser.
  Once that lands, the legacy `models/*-dump-*.py` scripts can be
  removed entirely — they're currently kept alongside the new
  tools/reference_backends/ modules with a LEGACY header pointing at
  the modular path, because the test drivers still consume the .npy
  filenames only the legacy scripts produce.

## Upstream dependencies

Full tracking is in `UPSTREAM.md`. Short summary:

- **[upstream]** whisper.cpp `examples/ffmpeg-transcode.cpp` mp4-family
  container crash. Workaround: pre-convert with ffmpeg one-liner.
- **[upstream]** ggml x86 AVX-VNNI / AVX512-VNNI dispatch for Q8_0 dot
  products. Closes the 5-second gap to ONNX INT8 on x86 servers.
- **[upstream]** NeMo Forced Aligner auxiliary CTC model standalone
  release. Not blocking — our converter extracts it from the `.nemo` tarball.
